^F06Foreword
^F02 
^F10"About seven years ago, I graduated from college and decided immediately to begin The Next Great Fantasy Epic.  Move over, Tolkien -- I'm armed with a degree in English, and I'm not afraid to use it.  Over the next year and a half of on-again, off-again work, I created a 225,000-word monster that I called Kingslayer.  Of course, I'd never even published a magazine article, let alone a novel, and after several costly rejections, it sat in a shoebox under my desk for years, while I went on with my career as a naval officer, got married, and otherwise took up different pursuits.
^F02 
^F10"But Kingslayer lurked in a hidden recess of my brain, and when I interviewed with TSR, I showed a copy to Jim Ward just to prove that I could write a lot of words every day for a living.  And, having served the purpose of helping me become employed with TSR, Kingslayer returned to its shoebox under my desk and gathered some more dust.
^F02 
^F10"Then, about a year ago, Colin and I were assigned to develop the next new game world for TSR.  Our first maps were drawn on a dry-erase board, with cryptic notes like "big forest," "Russian guys," and "German traders." And while we were filling in hunks of territory on the map, I said to Colin, "You know, I've got some old material lying around that we could use." Colin didn't mind, so the Anuirean Empire finally reached print after living in a shoebox under my desk for seven years.  I guess the moral of this story is either persistence pays or never throw anything away -- you can decide.
^F02 
^F10"Of course, that old material underwent many changes in being translated from an ambitious stab at a novel into a living, breathing game world.  Suffice it to say that I never realized just how much work it takes to create a new product line! My thanks go out to Jeff Grubb, who was a wonderful source of ideas for the setting; Jon Pickens, who never left me alone even when I wanted him to go away; Roger Moore and Anne Brown for their tireless efforts to get everything just right; Tony Szczudlo for his sincere desire to turn our words into art; and most especially my lovely wife Kim, who put up with my many long hours of writing on weekends and evenings.  Look, honey, it's all done!"

^F02 
^F10"It's been a year since Rich and I began thinking about this world.  Though we had other obligations, we've had Cerilia on the brain for the better part of a year.  It was a good time and a hard ride, but I'll remember the days fondly -- especially throwing darts with Rich and Tony to evaluate ideas (a bull's-eye was a good idea; I had a few good ones, but Rich and Tony had most all the good ideas that day, until we switched to another idea-grading system).  The playtesting was great fun, too, with Roger's psychotic postings and his countless undead legions crashing across Alamie.
^F02 
^F10"On the other hand, it's also been a brain-wracking time.  Rich and I wanted this world to be different enough to distinguish it, but familiar enough that people will fall into it easily.  We wanted epic fantasy and in-depth role-playing.  We wanted it all, in short, and I think the result is a pretty fair representation.  Of course, there's stuff we couldn't put in here; that, I guess, is what the rest of the game line is for.  We've tried hard to make the world as rich as possible in this box, and I believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.
^F02 
^F10"I'm now going to thank an exhaustive list of people who gave comfort, friendship, and the odd idea, and then I'll forget lots of people who were involved and who'll hate me for not including them on this list.  Well, tough.  Here's everyone I could think of.
^F02 
^F10"Everyone at TSR, but especially those in my product group and those who helped shepherd it along (Tony "Logo Boy" Szczudlo, Andria "Quote Zone" Hayday, Roger "Legion of Insane Dead" Moore, Jeff "Abominations and Exploding Gods" Grubb, Anne "Two Mikes" Brown, Sue "Restless Soup" Weinlein, Tim "Duh Boss" Brown, and Jim "Duh REALLY BIG Boss" Ward); the too - big - to - list - everyone - but - you - know - who - you - are Milwaukee crowd (ideas and insight especially: Paul Buss, Laddie Voslar, and Dave Zenz); the Evanston/Chicago crowd (Jim Furbee, Brad Matheson, Paul Nelis, Kevin Pohle, Cheryl Silva, and Scott Unger); the Family crowd (Mom, Mike G., Dad, Mike and his wife Eva, Scott, Bill and his wife Nancy, Babbie, Gavin, and the rest of the extended family, too numerous to list); and the Miscellaneous Crowd: Tim Beach for his uncredited help in the Dragon Mountain" game (now shut up and leave me alone!), Tony DiTerlizzi for his helpful suggestions and the ones that we laughed at, and Mary Guzdziol for, well, everything.
^F02 
^F10"We've worked hard on this.  Feel free to let us know what you think.  But after all the work we've put into this, what do I have to say?
^F02

^F06An Overview of Cerilia
^F02 
More than sixty generations ago, my forefather held Roele's standard high at the battle of Mount Deismaar.  His name was Traederic Dosiere, and I often wonder what it must have been like to witness the greatest battle ever fought, to watch the champions of good and evil duel against each other, to view the destruction of the old gods and the birth of the new.  Was he frightened? I think he must have been.  I know from my family's legends that Traederic wasn't wounded in the fray.  But did he strike a blow, or was the standard bearer kept clear of the enemy? About this point, the stories are unclear.
^F02 
As a child, I used to imagine that I was Traederic Dosiere, and I fought valiantly.  In fact, the forces that defended Cerilia might have failed without me.  But those were only a boy's dreams of glory.
^F02 
I am Caliedhe Dosiere, the forty-seventh Chamberlain of Anuire, and no longer a boy by any stretch of the imagination.  Like my ancestors, I stand watch over the empty Iron Throne, waiting for the day when the Emperor's line shall return.  I still think of the great battle of Deismaar, and how it made our world what it is today, and I can scarcely believe that common women and men such as Traederic Dosiere were part of such legendary events.
^F02 
I have always believed that man cannot direct his future without first understanding his past.  The Khinasi say that he who ignores history is doomed to repeat it.  For this reason, I have decided to set quill to parchment and create this atlas.  In my lifetime, I have seen no evidence that this great darkness, this chaos and war that wreathe Anuire, will end before I die.  For the Chamberlains who will follow me, the sons of my sons, I will leave this record of my world.
^F02 
Thousands of tomes of history fill dusty shelves in the Imperial Library, and nearly as many maps, geographies, and atlases slumber in the records of the Imperial Cartographical Society.  But I do not believe that lands and peoples can be discussed separately and still capture the essence of either.  The peoples of Cerilia have been shaped by their history, just as they have always and will always make that history.  A people and its past are like the hound chasing its tail.
^F02 
In this effort, I hope to link the people and the lands of Cerilia in one discussion, to shed some illumination on matters that may have eluded previous texts.  Only in this manner will my descendants truly understand what it is like to live in my time.
^F02 
^F05The Bloodlines (An Overview)
^F02 
As you undoubtedly know, my sons, those who fought at the battle of Mount Deismaar and survived the destruction of the gods were imbued with a divine essence that they passed on to their descendants.  By my estimate, about one thousand Anuireans can claim descent from these ancient bloodlines.  Presumably, a similar number of Brechts, Khinasi, Rjurik, and Vos are blooded as well, although I would not be surprised if the lesser Rjurik and Vos populations reflected a smaller count of blooded scions.  I myself, your ancestor, am proud to be of the Dosiere bloodline, derived from Anduiras himself.
^F02 
The history of the bloodlines is, to a great extent, the history of Cerilia since the War of Shadow.  As a descendant of one of these lines, I urge you to study your family's history closely.  You may find this to be a useful tool in understanding how you came to be the person you are.
^F02 
^n
^F05To the Regents
^F02 
I must assume that some will read this who are not my descendants.  I hope that some who turn these pages are regents, rulers of domains, so that they may learn from my words.
^F02 
To my knowledge, no one has ever explained how it is that the land responds to the bloodlines.  All I know is that for some reason, a blooded leader is linked to his land, his people, and his holdings by a mystical force of great power.  My father told me that members of the Roele family were surrounded by a radiant halo, a visible mark of their power and kingship over the lands of Anuire.  Others in Cerilia are possessed of similar manifestations of their blood.  I must implore those of you who are regents to rule well and wisely; you wield great power and responsibility, and you must not abuse it.
^F02 
^F06History of Cerilia
^F02 
^F05Cerilia of Old
^F02 
I shall first endeavor to explain how the events of the distant past still affect us today.  Modern Cerilia is shaped by ancient deeds as surely as the land is carved by wind and water.  When you understand how history molded the peoples of Cerilia, you will better understand the way we live today.
^F02 
Contrary to popular belief, humans were not always the dominant race in Cerilia.  The true natives of Cerilia are the elves and dwarves, the keepers of the forest and the guardians of the mountain.  For centuries, they lived peacefully alongside each other, neither race intruding on the other.  Both had precious little time to bother with the other, for each had its own enemies to fend off.  Those enemies were the humanoids -- creatures spawned deep in the earth.  Gnolls, goblins, orogs, and trolls swarmed through Cerilia at will.  These races still trouble the world even in my time.
^F02 
These creatures of night and darkness chose to live in places that the elves and dwarves shunned.  They raided continually, storming the dwarven mountains and the elven forests to steal treasures and lay siege to the demihuman civilizations.  Matters continued in this vein for hundreds, even thousands of years; we cannot be sure, since the elves don't count the years as we do, and the dwarven calendars are indecipherable.
^F02 
Civilization all but stagnated during this time.  The elves built slender towers and the dwarves constructed their stonewrought wonders, but all these marvels eventually fell to one marauding tribe or another.  In return, the elves slaughtered tribes of gnolls and goblins, while the dwarves drove the orogs deeper and deeper into the recesses of the mountains.  The resulting stalemate seemed as if it would continue forever, and all sides longed for a way to break it.  Had they known what was in store for them, they might have realized that their situation was not as grave as they perceived.
^F02 
In time, the humans arrived; actually, they not so much arrived as invaded.  Five separate tribes, fleeing the domination of decadent empires and the wrath of an evil god, crossed into Cerilia via a land-bridge from the southern lands and began to settle here.  A sixth tribe joined them from the lands far to the east beyond the Dragon Sea.  The Cerilian wilderness was thus touched by the hand of man, and would never again be the same.
^F02 
^F11The Tribes
^F02 
Our ancestors, then, were six tribes.  Five made their homes in the great southern continent of Aduria; one dwelled in a land far to the east of the Cerilian continent.  The six peoples, although widely different in culture, venerated a common pantheon.  Each worshiped one particular god above the rest.  The gods each favored a particular tribe over all the others, and lent their favor and attributes to those who followed their teachings.
^F02 
The pantheon comprised the god of nobility and war, Anduiras (also head of the pantheon); the god of the woods and streams, Reynir; the goddess of commerce and fortune, Brenna; the lord of moon and magic, Vorynn; the lady of the seas, Masela; the queen of the sun, Basaia; and the face of evil, Azrai the Shadow.  The tribe that followed Anduiras called themselves the Andu; they later came to be known as the Anuireans.  They were a warlike and vigorous people who took the lead in the war to claim Cerilia.  (My distant ancestors were, of course, Andu, although I regret that I cannot trace my genealogy more than three generations past Traederic Dosiere.)
^F02 
The tribe that followed Reynir was called the Rjuven; they were a people who revered nature.  They eventually called their lands Rjurik.  The Brechts venerated Brenna, and cultivated sharp wits and nimble fingers.  Believe it or not, the Vos were once diviners and illusionists who sought truth in magic.  The last of the five Adurian tribes, the Masetians, have vanished entirely from Cerilia.  They were sailors who followed the goddess Masela, braving the stormy seas.  No tribe dedicated itself to the evil Azrai.
^F02 
Although these tribes, at first clustered in the northern portion of Aduria, had their share of squabbles with each other, their true enemy lay in the decadent southern empires of Aduria.  Our oldest myths describe how the Shadow led the Adurian emperors along paths of corruption and destruction.  Thus, when these empires turned their attentions to the tribes in the northern lands, the leaders of the Five Tribes knew it was time to flee into the realms dominated by the elven folk and the monsters -- into Cerilia.
^F02 
^F05The Flight from the Shadow
^F02 
Where the waters of the Straits of Aerele now flow, a barren land-bridge once linked Aduria to Cerilia.  This isthmus marked the path of the tribes' exodus.  The journey was arduous -- many people fell to disease, goblin raids, natural hazards, and sometimes, stupidity.  Despite the perils of the journey, the pilgrims at last reached Cerilia and found a land ripe for conquest.  They also found the Basarji.
^F02 
The Basarji were a dark-skinned people from beyond the Sea of Dragons.  We now believe that they descended from the same stock as the five tribes, for their gods were the same as (or at least remarkably similar to) those venerated by our ancestors; the Basarji worshiped the goddess Basaia.
^F02 
Independently, the six tribes of newcomers set to dominating Cerilia with a fervor never before seen on the continent.
^F02 
^F11The Conflict
^F02 
Cerilia's dwarves, meanwhile busy holding back orog forces in the mountains, had little time or inclination to investigate or negotiate with the humans.  The invaders, likewise busy, had more important things to do than brave the mountain passes the dwarves called home.  The two races eventually developed an unspoken agreement with each other, namely that humans were welcome in the mountains as long as they caused no trouble and would somehow contribute to society.  Otherwise, they would be driven out by the dwarves.
^F02 
The elves, on the other hand, found themselves suddenly competing with the humans for the most beautiful land in Cerilia.  At first, the elves thought they could all live in mutual enjoyment of the forest, with the humans respecting elven lands and the elves carefully avoiding the humans.  This arrangement worked for a time.
^F02 
The humans soon drew the attention of the humanoids that continually raided the forests.  Despite the ferocity of the humanoids, our forebears proved resourceful enough to stand fast, and eventually the humanoids were beaten back.  It was not long before the humans began looking toward elven lands as places for expansion.
^F02 
The elves fiercely resisted conquest, for they had fought long and hard against the humanoids to keep their lands.  When we began to force the elves from their ancestral homes, the elven leaders devised the gheallie Sidhe, or Hunt of the Elves.  Elven knights were commissioned to roam the lands held by the elves, slaying whatever humans they found trespassing in their borders.  Simple peasants and woodcutters gathering firewood were slain as brutally as the highest ranking human warriors.  An all-out war erupted between the two races.
^F02 
Still, the elves were pushed back year after year because of an element they had never encountered -- priestly magic.  The elves could easily call upon the forces inherent in wood and water, field and air, but had never worshiped deities -- and thus, could not even begin to understand this new source of power.  The human priests were the deciding force against the elves' expertise in magic and combat; the old gods favored humans to such an extent that the elves found themselves practically powerless.
^F02 
The fair folk eventually conceded the plains, the hills, and the coasts to the upstart humans, and withdrew to the sanctity of the forests, concentrating their efforts on destroying any humans foolish enough to venture there.  The only humans who dared penetrate the woodlands were those desiring elven knowledge or seeking revenge on the elves for their atrocities.  Such violators never returned from the woods.
^F02 
^F11The Shadow's Arrival
^F02 
For a time, our ancestors were virtually free to choose their destinies in this new land.  Though the ever-present threat of elven retaliation and humanoid incursion lingered, the humans found themselves all but unopposed in their efforts.  Kingdoms rose and fell as the tribes settled and tamed the land.  It was a vital, dangerous time, and Cerilia was still largely untouched.
^F02 
Then the Shadow came to Cerilia.  Following the trail of the fleeing humans, this god of evil known as Azrai made his way to the new land.  When he found that the humans had prospered in Cerilia, Azrai realized that more than a simple battle would be needed to destroy them -- he would have to rely on subversion and deceit.  Of course, these things came naturally to the Shadow.
^F02 
First, Azrai took his teachings to the goblins and gnolls in the land called Vosgaard (far up in northern Cerilia).  By nature, they had always believed in a creature with the powers of the Shadow; now he needed only to put his name to their belief.  He then granted the humanoids priestly abilities to prove his power.  Naturally, those creatures of greatest evil inclined toward Azrai's priesthood, and they rose to power quickly among the tribes of humanoids.
^F02 
Next, the god of evil visited the Vos (the humans dwelling in the same region).  Never realizing that Azrai was the Shadow from whom they had fled hundreds of years ago, they took his words of strength and power and made them their own.  In the land of darkness in which they lived, the Vos had abandoned their appreciation for the niceties of divination and illusion; the creatures around them understood the ways of the mace and the sword far, far better.  And so the Vos unknowingly fell to Azrai.
^F02 
Once the Vos had been thoroughly corrupted by the very teachings they had escaped to Cerilia to avoid, Azrai traveled to the elves and dwarves, whispering to them of revenge against their enemies, the destruction of all things unclean, and the restoration of Cerilia as it had once been.  He sought out the demihumans in dreams and omens, signs and portents, and spoke to them of the excellence of the past when no humans defiled the surface of Cerilia.
^F02 
The dwarves found nothing in Azrai's words to provoke them, so they steered clear of his temptations.  The elves, on the other hand, had burned with the desire for revenge ever since their exile to the deep woods.  They cleaved to the teachings of Azrai and poured their energy into preparations for war.
^F02 
All this time, the emperors of the southern continent had been busy.  Their armies, after easily conquering the lands vacated by the five original tribes, began the arduous march toward Cerilia.  The kings of the new Cerilian nations realized the danger on all sides of them, and began marshalling their forces to combat the encroaching evils.
^F02 
^F05The War of Shadow
^F02 
The Anuirean, Rjuven, Brecht, Basarji, and Masetian nations found no option other than to unite; kings set aside their now-petty differences to face the threat of the Shadow.  The priests of these lands ceased their squabbles and raised their voices not in heated argument, but in supplication to their gods.  Rogues and merchants brought their resources to the war, setting aside personal rivalries to combat the evil of Azrai.  Even the dwarves came into the war, for though they did not care about the human presence on the continent, they most certainly cared about the power the humanoids stood to gain.
^F02 
The armies of the Shadow, made up of the Vos, the humanoids, and the elves, pushed into Cerilia, dominating and destroying everything they encountered.  The armies of the human Cerilians were hard-pressed by the forces marching under the serpent banner, and it seemed certain that the Cerilians would be crushed beneath the heel of the Shadow.  Traederic Dosiere, my ancestor, fought throughout the war at the side of Haelyn and Roele, the two brothers who led the Anuireans.  Despite their heroic efforts, the combined forces of Aduria, Vosgaard, and the evil humanoids overwhelmed them.
^F02 
The gods knew that Azrai's final victory was at hand.  In a desperate attempt to prevent him from annihilating the Cerilians and enslaving the deities forever, the gods gathered their peoples' armies at the land bridge to Cerilia, near the foot of Mount Deismaar.  Each god chose a champion or two from among his or her tribes -- a champion who exemplified whatever the god loved best in humanity.  Traederic had the honor of carrying Roele's standard as Roele and Haelyn prepared for the battle on the slopes of Mount Deismaar.  Azrai himself led his champions, including Raesene (Haelyn and Roele's half-brother), and the armies of the Shadow to the mount.
^F02 
The clash on the slopes of Deismaar was an epic battle -- man and monster struggled against each other in a vain attempt to triumph.  Despite the bravery and skill of the Cerilian warriors, it seemed certain that sunset would find the forces of good dead on the slopes of Deismaar.
^F02 
Then, without warning, the elves crossed to the human side of the battlefield, slaughtering the Vos and the southern warriors as they swept across the mountain.  The elf generals had discovered Azrai for what he was, and realized they had been deceived.  (A handful of elves didn't care about Azrai's evil -- they sought only to rid their land of the humans.  These few remained with the Shadow.  Of them, Rhuobhe Manslayer is the most famous, of course.) All but a few of the elves cast aside the blindness of hatred, and they helped even the odds in the war considerably.
^F02 
It was then that Haelyn, champion of Anduiras and the Anuireans, stepped forward to battle the most powerful of Azrai's champions -- Raesene the Black Prince, who had sold himself to the god of evil.  All across the Mount, the gods' champions squared off against Azrai's minions.
^F02 
Higher up on the slopes of Deismaar, the gods themselves took physical form to try to defeat Azrai once and for all.  They poured every energy into the effort to destroy the shadow that had fallen across Cerilia.  The heavens shook; the earth rumbled.  All was chaos; then an ensuing explosion destroyed the landscape, leveling Deismaar and the lands for miles around the mighty mountain (and creating what we now call the Straits of Aerele).  Yet despite the force of the explosion, a few survived.  Most were scattered to the four winds, including nearly all the Masetians and good-aligned Vos.
^F02 
In a final bid for freedom from Azrai, the deities had given their very existences.  Their essences dissipated, and the remains of the old gods lay in the smoking crater that was the mountain.
^F02 
^n
^F05The Birth of the New Gods and the Abominations
^F02 
The survivors of the battle on Mount Deismaar were, with few exceptions, those common men and women who best exemplified the qualities the gods strove to uphold.  Yet the champions for the gods were conspicuously absent.  In their close proximity to the gods, they had taken the brunt of the divine essence released by the gods' deaths that washed across the land.  The champions, also closest to the gods in their ideals, were elevated to replace the vanished deities.
^F02 
The new gods numbered eight: Haelyn, assuming Anduras's reign over nobility and war; Erik, the druid, ruling the woods and streams in Reynir's stead; Sera, taking the place of Brenna as the goddess of fortune; Avani, taking the mantle of Basaia to become the matron of the Basarji; the Vos warriors Kriesha and Belinik, absorbing the energies of Azrai to become the Ice Lady and the Prince of Terror; Nesirie, absorbing the power of Masela and gaining power over the sea; and Ruornil, inheriting the magic of Vorynn.
^F02 
Even those survivors who mirrored the old gods less perfectly than the champions, as well as some of the elves, dwarves, and humanoids, absorbed the gods' divine energy.  Power flowed through them and about them, reflecting the natures of the gods who had sacrificed these energies.  Roele and Traederic were two such champions; they found themselves imbued with Anduiras's bloodline and in turn, wondrous abilities they had never before possessed.
^F02 
Of course, many of these survivors were eager to experiment with their new abilities, and they did so promptly, using other dazed survivors as targets.  A brief but bloody battle ensued as those begotten of Azrai fought their way free from the children of the other gods.  In doing so, they discovered that they could rip the godly power from their dead victims and make themselves that much stronger.  They soon called this bloodtheft.
^F02 
Many of Azrai's minions fought, but more of them escaped to remote hiding places.  They emerged occasionally throughout the next hundreds of years to kill those who carried the divine bloodlines, using their victims' liberated power to keep themselves alive and twist themselves ever further from their former humanity.  Among them were the Kraken, the Ghost, and the Raven.  There were others, too -- many others.
^F02 
The elves were the first to notice the evolution of these minions and to realize the cause of it.  They called the abominations the awnsheghlien (awn-SHAY-len), or "blood of darkness." The name soon carried a specific and horrible meaning, and in time, only the uneducated referred to these creatures as abominations.
^F02 
The mightiest of the awnsheghlien was the Gorgon, the remnant of humanity that once was Raesene, the half-brother of Haelyn and Roele.  The Gorgon's hatred of his brothers drove him to acts of destruction far greater than those schemed by his fellows, and thus his power grew more rapidly than theirs.  Even so, the other awnsheghlien were not to be regarded lightly -- their power still derived from Azrai himself, and they were eager to use it.
^F02 
Luckily for this land, the awnsheghlien were not the only ones who cultivated the powers of their gifts.  The children of those who had been infused with divine essence also grew in stature.  They, too, gained vitality from fallen foes who were empowered by the blood of the gods.  The children who used their inherited abilities found they could make themselves into powerful giants, but as they grew in divine might, their bodies transformed.  The power carried a price.
^F02 
Some who bore the blood established themselves as lords of lands.  They learned that they could gain even more might from the subjects of their domains and from the earth itself; they could increase the power of their kingdoms by pouring the blood back into it.  Those with native intelligence, brute strength, or a combination of both learned how to increase their power through wise rule and carefully planned campaigns geared toward pounding their neighbors into submission.
^F02 
So it was that the next struggle for domination of Cerilia began, only a few short years after the War of Shadow.  Would-be rulers sought to carve out their own kingdoms, not only by conquering lands and peoples, but by personally administering the deaths of current kings.  This would not only ensure the legitimacy of their claims to the thrones, but also consume the bloodline.  These power-hungry men and women of the blood sought the ultimate power -- rule of Cerilia by absorbing the blood of the gods.
^F02 
^F11The Shadow World
^F02 
Coincidentally (or perhaps not), this time also marked the discovery of the Shadow World.  This region (presumably of another dimension, we have since surmised) seems to coexist with Cerilia and occasionally overlap into our land.  The landscape is eerily similar to Cerilia, and events in Cerilia are mirrored in the Shadow World.  This realm, however, is populated by undead creatures; skeletons and zombies serve as laboring peasants, ghouls run towns, and ghosts control entire kingdoms.
^F02 
As you may know, it has been discovered that "weak spots" exist -- something like oiled parchment in windows that allows light to pass but keeps out solid materials.  These weak spots are almost always places of death and destruction, and they allow the Shadow World to press in on Cerilia.  At these weak spots, undead can pass through to wreak terror on the living -- but also, the living may stumble through to a land of terror.  Still, during the time of conquest that followed the war against Azrai, the Shadow World posed little threat to those who knew of its dangers, and no one saw an immediate way to destroy it, so the rulers continued on their quests for domination and ignored this strange discovery.
^F02 
To this day, the Shadow World remains a place of mystery to everyone but the halflings who live scattered throughout Cerilia.  A few souls have set about studying that realm, but most folk prefer not to talk about it.  In some parts, mention of the Shadow World is strictly forbidden.
^F02 
^F05Formation of Empire
^F02 
A few conquerors, who decided to use more reason than sword edge when building empires, demand mention.  There were also those who had a bit of an advantage in tapping their divine powers.  One of these was Roele, brother of the new god Haelyn.
^F02 
The new gods made a pact that they would never meet in the world in physical form (to avoid another cataclysm of Deismaar's magnitude).  However, they had full freedom and every instinct to give advice to their people, for they felt their former humanity strongly and fondly remembered their families and former neighbors and lands.  Haelyn, as a result, walked with Roele in dreams and promised his brother support if only Roele would try to bring peace to Cerilia.
^F02 
Thus, unlike most of his contemporaries, Roele chose to use his new powers not to glorify his own station, but to forge an empire of justice that would stand against time.  He was fortunate to have the intelligence and nobility of his brother as well as the ability to set aside personal honor when his vision of the empire depended on it.
^F02 
First, Roele gathered together friends who had stood at the battle of Mount Deismaar with him.  With them at his side, he accomplished the awesome task of uniting the southwestern corner of the continent, using his divine power to defeat half a dozen minor kings.  My ancestor Traederic was one of his lieutenants -- the proud herald and standard-bearer for Roele's armies.  In a relatively short time, Roele brought most of what we now recognize as the Heartlands and the Southern Coast of Anuire under his rule, and those who saw his power flocked to his banner.
^F02 
Roele called his kingdom Anuire after those who had first settled the land.  By granting lands to those who had supported him in battle, he ensured their loyalty and, in turn, the loyalty of their vassals: we Dosieres became chamberlains to the Roeles, and have held this station ever since, even though the line of Roele has failed.  With his core of power behind him, Roele felt enough confidence to try to bring the rest of Cerilia under his rule.
^F02 
He looked to the east and north, seeking to dominate Rjurik and Brechtur.  His success with the Rjurik was limited, for the warriors of the frozen tundra knew the terrain far better than his knights ever could.  He retreated from Rjurik lands, but won the leaders over with kind words and fine gifts.
^F02 
Despite this initial difficulty, Roele pressed on.  He found the sea-faring Brechts a much easier target than the Rjurik -- if an invader simply closes off a sailor's port, how does the sailor return? The Brechts eventually capitulated to the Anuirean forces, and Roele was free to move on to the Basarji.
^F02 
Though the Basarji mages were formidable, enhanced as they were with the power of the gods, Roele's stratagems and power were enough to bring the Basarji under the Anuirean heel.  They did not go down without a fight, but eventually they tumbled.
^F02 
Roele then turned his attention north, to Vosgaard.  The other northern kingdoms did not deserve his hatred -- they were merely lands to be added to the Anuirean Empire.  The Vos, however, had allied with Azrai and the humanoids, and had shown themselves to be (in Roele's eyes) unworthy of life.
^F02 
Perhaps his hatred clouded his thinking, or perhaps the new Vos gods helped their people in ways unseen.
The annals of the war in Vosgaard are lost, but legends tell that the Vos gods forced the awnsheghlien to fight against the Anuireans.  We do know that the humanoids, whose tribes continued to grow ever larger in the Vosgaard wastes, were instrumental in defeating the Anuirean forces.  Traederic Dosiere died in this campaign, but his oldest son, Boeran, took his father's place at Roele's side.
^F02 
Although Roele had not conquered the entire continent, he had done a fair job of uniting it.  When Roele died, his heirs continued to rule the Empire wisely and well, even granting some measure of independence to various people within it.  Descendants of bloodlines frequently squabbled among themselves, challenging each other for the right to rule and the right to continue a bloodline, but the Empire stood strong for almost a thousand years.  Roele's line remained dominant above all -- until, one day, disaster befell the continent.
^F02 
^F05The History of the Ruins of Empire
^F02 
Our Empire's prosperity lasted until five hundred years before the writing of this account.  At that time, Michael Roele, the only scion of the line, had the foolish audacity to challenge the Gorgon.  Slipping into the Gorgon's citadel, Michael braved untold dangers to face his kinsman, the most powerful of the awnsheghlien.  Unsurprisingly, he was slain by the Gorgon.  Upon his death, the Empire crumbled despite the efforts of the Chamberlain -- my forefather, Aedan Dosiere.  Everyone who had anticipated vying for Michael's crown and his Iron Throne found themselves with a very good chance of achieving their dreams.  But instead of trying to preserve the Anuirean Empire, the power-hungry dukes and lords cared for nothing but claiming the Iron Throne for themselves.
^F02 
Continuous civil wars racked Anuire for more than 70 years after Michael's death.  The subject peoples -- the Rjurik, the Brechts, and the western Khinasi -- rebelled against our chaotic rule and reclaimed their own destinies.  The men and women ruling in Anuire desired only their greater glory, and ignored the needs of the Empire as a whole.  The regents and kings sought each other's heads rather than minds, and kingdoms rather than kinship, hoping to become ever more powerful.
^F02 
Of course, the chaos couldn't go on forever.  Eventually, the two most powerful warring factions -- the Boeruines and the Avans -- signed a peace treaty, and the rest of the shattered Empire settled down enough that approximate borders could be drawn.  A score of bloodlines and new kings emerged from this chaos.
^F02 
Today, the bulk of the land remains uneasy and divided.  The people yearn for peace, but every ruler believes that he and only he is the one to bring it to Cerilia.  Because of this, the land is forced to endure needless strife and will continue to do so until a true leader emerges from the many bloodlines.  All the land needs is the hand of a wise and noble leader to guide it, and the Empire could be reborn.
^F02 
Who were the forgers of Cerilia's history? What were they like? An atlas means nothing without some discussion of the peoples who have made these lands their home.
^F02 
Cerilia is a broad, rich continent home to dozens of races, but humans are by far the dominant race.  In the span of 2,000 years, humans have dotted the land with towns and settlements, pushing back the elves and the various humanoids.  But other races are still numerous and powerful.  In fact, in recent times, many lands once held by humans have reverted to wilderness as the Empire's strength has waned and failed.
^F02 
What follows is a description of the major races that inhabit Cerilia.  Though only a few actively vie for control of the continent, all are important in one way or another.  These are by no means the only races found in Cerilia.  The common factor among all the races, however, is that divine bloodlines flow strongly in each.
^F02 
^n
^F06Races of Cerilia
^F02 
^F05Humans
^F02 
The humans of Cerilia vary widely; no less than five distinct human cultures dwell here.  We also know that several more human cultures inhabit the great southern land of Aduria.  Cerilia's peoples are spread across the entire continent, and though there is some intermingling, the Cerilians have done an excellent job of maintaining their respective heritages and ways of life.
^F02 
^F11The Anuireans
^F02 
You know, of course, that I am an Anuirean.  I and my countrymen are the descendants of the ancient Andu, the first of the six tribes to set foot in Cerilia.  We hold the lands from the southern Straits of Aerele to the Silverhead Mountains in the north, and from the waters of the Miere Rhuann in the west to the mighty Iron Peaks to our east.  Once, the Anuirean Empire spanned the entire continent.  Following the lead of Emperor Roele, our ancestors dominated the other cultures of the land, and it seemed certain that Anuire would bring the disparate bloodlines together and unite the land forever.
^F02 
However, the death of Michael Roele changed all that, and the Anuireans as a whole are now no more and no less powerful than the other peoples of Cerilia.  Still, our lands are broad and strong, our cities are rich in trade and learning, and our armies are the finest in the world.  Anuire enjoys temperate weather, the fields yield bountiful harvests, and the city of Anuire (where even now I am penning this manuscript) is still the center of light and civilization in this darkening world.  It's no wonder that my people were able to maintain peace in Cerilia for centuries.
^F02 
Most of our rulers are titled nobles.  In the days of the Empire's dominance, the nobles were a class of warriors, responsible for fielding armies of knights and footsoldiers at the Emperor's command.  In those days, Anuire was a feudal and warlike state, and with Haelyn as our patron, we nearly ruled the world.  Today, many of Anuire's divided lands are still ruled by the descendants of those noble warriors, although the collapse of the old order also brought about the end of feudalism, the freedom of peasants to choose their own homes, and the rise of free farmers and guildsmen.
^F02 
While Anuire enjoys the strongest armies, highest culture, and richest lands of Cerilia, it is a tragic truth that we are a divided people.  Could we only set aside our differences and rebuild the Empire, we would again bring peace, culture, and prosperity to all Cerilia.  But instead, every regent aspires to be the next Roele.  Our strength and honor is wasted feuding amongst ourselves; small kings and short-sighted nobles spend their time in petty squabbles.
^F02 
^F11The Brechts
^F02 
The Brechts are sea-faring traders who ply their ships through the frozen Krakenaurricht in central Cerilia to reach foreign ports.  Though they have the most exposure to other continents and cultures, they are also among the most insular of peoples.  They've seen how other people live, and while they don't necessarily disapprove, the Brechts are far more comfortable with their own way of life.
^F02 
The Brecht nobles were gravely weakened by centuries of Anuirean occupation; today, nobles hold power in only a few of the Brecht states.  Most Brecht leaders are rogues calling themselves merchants.  Their patron deity is Sera (we know her as Sarimie), the goddess of fortune and commerce, and so the Brechts model their lives around her ideals.  As a result, the merchant class is the highest rank one can gain in Brecht society, and many sailors give their lives trying to achieve it.  Money, not nobility or knowledge, is the driving force behind Brecht society.
^F02 
The Brechts are, above all, pragmatic.  They generally won't fight a battle they're sure to lose, instead preferring to bargain their way out of it.  Most of them won't betray friends for the sake of a profit, but as in any society, it has been known to happen.  They are not entirely cold to the needs of others, but they do tend to weigh the costs and benefits of their actions.  I find that many Brecht merchants are quite full of themselves, as if their wealth and position makes them completely unassailable.
^F02 
The Brecht lands, which encircle the Krakennauricht, are divided from the rest of the continent by mountains.  Having been beaten once by an overland army, they're determined not to let it happen again.  The passes through the mountains are well guarded, and the Brechts see themselves as unbeatable at sea.
^F02 
^F11The Khinasi
^F02 
The Khinasi are descendants of the people known as the Basarji, and live along the southern and eastern coasts of Cerilia.  Their lands range from the Iron Peaks in the west to the Sea of Dragons in the east, and are bordered in the north by the Coulladaraight and the Rhuannadaraight forests.  The western city-states fell under Anuirean control for several hundred years, although most of the eastern lands were never part of the Empire.
^F02 
The Khinasi, like the Brechts, make much of their living through trade.  While the Brechts tend to trade to the north and west, as well as with the Vos and Rjurik, the Khinasi practice their commerce with the Anuireans and with their ancestors across the Sea of Dragons.  Unlike the Brechts, the Khinasi assimilate any aspects of other cultures they find valuable, yet maintain a core lifestyle that is most assuredly Basarji in origin.  
^F02 
The Basarji became known as the Khinasi because of their most famous leader in times past.  The mage-king el-Arassi rose during the Anuirean occupation of Basarji lands and, through his skillful manipulation of politics and magic, forced the Empire to grant a measure of independence to the Basarji city-states.  In gratitude, the Basarji named themselves "Khinasi," or "lands under the protection of el-Arassi." Though they retained their tribal name of Basarji, they became known as the Khinasi through the rest of Cerilia.
^F02 
The Khinasi live in city-states scattered throughout their lands.  Most such kingdoms hold only one city of any importance, while the outlying provinces provide livestock and other goods.  The king rules the surrounding provinces from the comforts of the city.  In most lands, the people are free to travel from the provinces to petition the king.
^F02 
Khinasi rulers are usually mages, for the culture values education and believes the study of magic to be the noblest of callings.  The Khinasi respect graciousness, bearing, and hospitality; a man's wealth is measured by his ability to entertain his guests, and not how much gold or silver he may have.
^F02 
^F11The Rjurik
^F02 
Occupying the wind-swept lands north of Anuire, the Rjurik make their living by hunting, fishing, and herding in the hills and moors of their territory.  The Rjurik rely on self-sufficiency to see them through, yet they also place a strong bond on the clan.  They are nomads in the summer, but return to their halls at first snowfall, there to keep the cold at bay with feasts and roaring hearth-fires.  Hunting parties venture out into the cold as necessary to replenish their larders.  Because of the harsh landscape and the ever-present danger of monsters, the Rjurik almost never travel alone.
^F02 
The Rjurik are led by jarls, but the true rulers of the people are the druids who dwell in groves.  They bend the Rjurik opinions and conduct the rites that keep the culture mighty.  The jarls seek out the druids in the oaks and taiga, searching for words of wisdom to guide their people.  I have always believed that we Anuireans have underestimated the druids in Rjurik society, and that many of our conflicts stem from this mistake.
^F02 
There is little war in Rjurik.  For one thing, the Rjurik people don't see the need to glorify themselves through massive battles.  For another, clans are usually a good distance from each other, making the logistics of battle uncertain.  Finally, the Rjurik prefer one-on-one challenges when an insult is dealt or when an upstart seeks to become the new jarl, rather than wasting precious lives in large conflicts.
^F02 
This is not to say that they will not fight wars.  When foreign armies invade the tundra, the Rjurik can mobilize faster than nearly any army in Cerilia, as our northern rulers have learned over and over again.  Since they know their land well, they can travel across it far faster than their enemies, and reinforcements seem to arrive at supernatural speeds.
^F02 
^F11The Vos
^F02 
The Vos are by far the most brutal and the most misunderstood of the humans.  They live in the area of Cerilia that is known by three colorful names: the Lands of Darkness, the Brutal Lands, and the Lands of Midnight Sun.  The region is populated heavily by humanoids and monsters.  The Vos have a reputation for being nearly as cruel as the humanoids they hunt.
^F02 
Though all these things are true of the Vos, most people don't take one important detail into account: The Vos live in the harshest part of Cerilia, surrounded by inhuman creatures.  Though they once worshiped the god of the moon and magic, they've found precious little solace in his teachings.  It's small wonder, then, that they've turned to gods more suited to their land -- gods of cold and rage.
^F02 
The Vos rulers are priests of the evil Kriesha (the Ice Lady), and Belinik (Prince of Terror).  These priests earn the Vos their reputation, for they encourage continual warfare on each other and those surrounding them.  Those who are not priests rarely have power in Vosgaard, for one of the few threats against which the Vos leaders will unite is any leader whose visions don't come from the gods.
^F02 
Taken individually, the Vos are actually decent people.  Though they don't believe in mercy, they understand compassion.  While they're savage in battle, they have a firm code of honor.  And while they hunt their enemies ruthlessly, true friends are most treasured.
^F02 
^F05Elves
^F02 
The elves of Cerilia call themselves the Sidhelien (SHEE-lin).  They are a beautiful but dangerous folk, and humans are well advised to stay away from the elven woods.  The Sidhelien, while so civilized that their music can bring tears to the eyes of the roughest forester, also have a core of savagery that truly permeates their being.  Having coexisted with the brutal humanoids for thousands of years, the elves have had to learn to deal harshly with their opponents.  In addition, everything they built over the past millennia has come crashing down around them since the arrival of the humans such a short time (about two elven generations) ago.
^F02 
As such, they harbor deep hatred in their collective psyche for those who've dispossessed them.  This extends to humans, humanoids, and whomever stands in the way of the elven dominion.
^F02 
There are elves who take a more rational view of the whole situation, seeing the humans as a catalyst in elven evolution.  These elves look to the humans for ways to improve the elven kingdoms and to teach the elves the realities of living in modern Cerilia.
^F02 
The Elven Court is currently fractured from a single large kingdom into many small ones, just as our Empire is shattered.  Every elven settlement now has its own version of the Elven Court, but none match the glories of the original.  I believe that the elves hope to reunite the elven lands someday to recapture the beauty and grace of the past.  Elven rulers vary from court to court, depending on the values of the elves of that nation.  The elves of Tuarhievel favor warriors, while those of the Sielwode prefer mages as their leaders.  Of course, each court prefers its type of leader over all others, so if the elves are ever to reconcile and reunite, they must first learn to blend their values and tastes.
^F02 
^F01SEE ELVES-MORE INFO FOR MORE INFORMATION.
^F02 
^F05Dwarves
^F02 
The dwarves of Cerilia are a strong, enduring folk who enjoy hard living and hard work.  They are filled with an irrepressible store of good cheer and song.  Though the dwarves have willingly undertaken the responsibility of keeping the orogs in check under the mountains, they prefer to lead lives of building and making, not warring.
^F02 
Dwarven kingdoms are organized around the clan, and clan members' loyalty is to their clan first and king second.  The clan leaders, in turn, first serve their people, and swear fealty to the dwarven king.  The dwarven king must therefore be an adept negotiator and a shrewd politician to keep his people together.
^F02 
Dwarves learn the arts of war at an early age as a part of their self-appointed duty of containing the orogs in the caverns under the mountains.  The orogs have, strangely enough, grown ever stronger in their years of confinement, and the dwarves have had to become that much better in warfare to control the orog menace.  This is part of the reason that they prefer not to deal with outsiders -- visitors distract the sentries.
^F02 
As well as being skilled fighters, the dwarves of Cerilia are also excellent miners.  Each dwarf clan specializes in the mining of a certain material, so that one clan may search out gems and others may specialize in specific ores.  The clans within a kingdom tend to complement one another, so no clan is left with a useless skill.
^F02 
^F01SEE DWARVES-MORE INFO FOR MORE INFORMATION.
^F02 
^F05Monsters
^F02 
Creatures of nightmare and legend roam Cerilia -- beasts that tear and rend and destroy.  It is also plagued by a well-organized culture of humanoids who, if they were willing to put aside their differences, might have a chance to grow powerful.
^F02 
^F11The Humanoids
^F02 
Goblins, gnolls, orogs, and other such creatures have lived in Cerilia for thousands of years.  The most dominant of these are the goblins, who control vast stretches of land in Anuire, Rjurik, and Vosgaard.  They're well organized and cruel, and they conduct raids with terrifying regularity.  Though they're cowardly when confronted individually, the goblins present a serious threat when they band together.  They are fairly intelligent, and even maintain treaties unless it pleases them to violate the terms.  They tend to emulate the cultures nearest them in a twisted interpretation, so Anuirean goblins are known to have some honor, while Vos goblins are far more savage than their distant kin.
^F02 
Gnolls also have a solid presence in Cerilia.  They generally live as bands of nomads, although a few regions exist that are nothing but gnollish.  Unlike goblins, lone gnolls present certain danger.  They are fierce fighters that rarely listen to reason; this is reflective of their lifestyle, which is barely above animal level.  They can be bribed with trinkets and food, but they won't stay bought for long.
^F02 
There are rumors that the orogs under the mountains are mustering for war again, but since the dwarves fiercely guard the orog tunnels, the truth of these tales is not verified.
^F02 
^F11The Awnsheghlien
^F02 
The most dangerous creatures in Cerilia are the awnsheghlien -- those creatures that absorbed the essence of the evil Azrai.  Like other blooded beings, they can gain strength by controlling domains and through bloodtheft.  They are, therefore, the most powerful of antagonists, for they are continually feeding off hapless scions and foolish kings.
^F02 
An awnshegh is any creature imbued with the blood of Azrai that traps divine essence within itself rather than giving it back to the land.  This process is too much for a mortal frame, and it warps the body even as it makes the flesh more powerful.  These distortions usually reflect some aspect of the mind inside.
^F02 
Some awnsheghlien have created servants that reflect their masters' names.  The Hydra, for example, has spawned scores of multi-headed creatures, while the Gorgon allows its smaller children to run rampant to terrorize western Cerilia.  Those who would battle the awnsheghlien should be cautioned that killing a hydra is nothing like killing the Hydra.
^F02 
In my lifetime, I have encountered three awnsheghlien.  One was a nameless wanderer -- a horror of slashing talons and bloodlust.  That one, my companions and I slew.  The second was the Seadrake, which sank a ship on which I had taken passage.  My modest command of the mystic arts was all that allowed me to preserve my own life.
^F02 
The last awnshegh I met was the Gorgon.  Although it was more than forty years ago, I remember that encounter as if it were last evening's nightmare.  I had been sent to Kal-Saitharak (the Gorgon's citadel within his domain) as part of a diplomatic mission to discuss with the Gorgon possible trade through the passes of Mur-Kilad.  I found the Gorgon to be extremely intelligent and well spoken, but I was conscious of an aura of malign patience and controlled hatred around him.  He insisted on being called Prince Raesene.  Unfortunately, one of my companions offended him with a poor choice of words, and the Gorgon slew him with his dire gaze.  The mission ended in failure, although our lives were spared.
^F02 
Now that I have familiarized you with the people and the forces that shaped the map of Cerilia, it is time to begin the atlas proper.  Even as I begin my task, though, I find that the step from participant to chronicler has already opened my eyes, when I had intended to open yours.  In settling my thoughts and notes, I have rediscovered a basic truth that I had almost forgotten in my years of service to the Iron Throne: Cerilia is a troubled land.  It is a chaotic patchwork of nations, cultures, religions, and traditions.  Wars and feuds are all too common; even peaceful lands must vigilantly defend their borders against expansive neighbors and the plots of awnsheghlien.  There can be no lasting peace until the bloodlines stand united and cease their eternal conflict.
^F02 
Though the history of Cerilia is a tragic one, it is not without glorious moments.  Strong kingdoms and rich cities punctuate the landscape from the Sea of Storms to the golden waters of the Dragonsea.  It would be the labor of a lifetime to create an exhaustive list of Cerilia's divided realms, its towns and villages, and every dark forest or vine-covered ruin (and such a work would be tragically out of date upon the poor chronicler's demise).  This atlas, then, will provide thumbnail sketches of as many regions as the fates will allow.
^F02 
In the Royal Observatory of Anuire, cartographers traditionally divide Cerilia into five regions: Anuire, Rjurik, Brechtur, Khinasi, and Vosgaard.  Each is named after the principal human group that first settled there.  Of course, over time, the boundaries of kingdoms shift and fail.  In many places, the lands have fallen wild or have been claimed by an awnshegh.  Despite this, these five regions make logical divisions for discussing the lands and sites of Cerilia.
^F02 
^F06Atlas of Cerilia
^F02 
^F05Anuire
^F02 
The southwestern corner of Cerilia is the home of the ancient Anuirean Empire.  This is my home, the land of my forefathers for almost 2,000 years.  Anuire is a green and fair land, with broad and fertile river valleys, rolling hills and highlands, and the most favorable weather in Cerilia.  These beautiful lands are home to dozens of rival baronies, duchies, and free cities.  The borderlands of the old Empire are largely abandoned in these darker days; goblinkind and bandits prosper in the Empire's absence.
^F02 
The former Empire was once made up of the Twelve Duchies of Anuire plus the lands conquered by the Roeles then.  Today, eleven of the twelve realms still exist (in addition to younger Anuirean kingdoms): Boeruine, Mhoried, Diemed, Avanil, Alamie, Aerenwe, Elinie, Talinie, Taeghas, Osoerde, and Cariele.  The lands that are currently controlled by Ghoere were also among the Twelve, but that name is of recent vintage.
^F02 
^F11The Sea of Storms
^F02 
The sea to the west of Cerilia is known as Miere Rhuann, or the Sea of Storms.  It is a gray, treacherous body of water with dense fogs, heavy seas, and frequent gales.  Much of the Cerilian coastline is mountainous and thus barren of harbor or shelter, so ports are few and far between.  Most seafarers sail far from the coast to avoid the rocky shores of Boeruine and Talinie.  Sailors tell stories of mighty storm giants living in submarine grottoes in the coastal waters.
^F02 
At the height of the Empire, Anuire's power extended across the Sea of Storms to many strange lands on distant shores.  A few Anuirean traders still visit these far ports, but the Anuirean provosts who governed them are long gone.
^F02 
^F11The Gorgon's Crown
^F02 
North and east of Mhoried, the Stonecrown Mountains collide with the Hoarfells in a twisted knot of stark peaks and impassable gorges.  This riven land is the Gorgon's Crown, the seat of the Gorgon's power.  Dark towers watch over the narrow passes leading into the Gorgon's land, and the mountains are riddled with secret armories and forges of his armies.  
^F02 
The center of the Gorgon's realm is the great fortress Kal-Saitharak; in Anuirean lands, it is called the Battlewaite.
^F02 
Five hundred years ago, the Gorgon slew Michael Roele.  The Gorgon's armies conquered Markazor, the goblin kingdom, soon after.  And two centuries ago, the Gorgon unleashed his armies against the Brecht land of Kiergard and razed it utterly.
^F02 
The Gorgon's emissaries and spies permeate Anuirean lands.  It is said that no man has seen the Gorgon's face and lived, but I know that to be untrue.  Since meeting him, I truly believe the legend that the Gorgon is none other than Raesene the Black Prince, who once led the ancient Anuireans against the elves, and who was seduced by the promises of the dark Azrai.
^F02 
^F11The Aelvinnwode
^F02 
In the old tongue of the Rjurik, Aelvinnwode simply means "elven wood." Once, this vast northern forest was home to dozens of shining elven kingdoms where no human had ever set foot.  The first human tribes that came to Cerilia nearly 2,000 years ago invaded this forest, driving the elves out of their ancestral homes.  Now, large tracts of this forest have been cleared by generations of woodcutters and farmers.
^F02 
The only elven realm to survive here is the powerful kingdom of Tuarhievel (twah-REE-eh-vel).  While other elven kingdoms fought against the human invaders or fled their lands, the elves of Tuarhievel swallowed their pride and opened their lands to human trade.  Other elf nations despised Tuarhievel's capitulation, but it allowed the realm to stay whole and secure while other lands fell to ruin.
^F02 
Tuarhievel is ruled by a proud prince, Fhileraene, a young elf who recently ascended the throne.  It's rumored that Fhileraene favors the circles that wish Tuarhievel's borders closed to humans once again.
^F02 
^F11The Stonecrown Mountains
^F02 
Stark and forbidding, the mighty Stonecrowns in northern Anuire span the area from The Five Peaks in the west to the great wall of the Gorgon's Crown in the east.  Deep, hidden valleys and broken foothills together with dense old forests that cap the barren peaks prevent easy crossing of the mountains.
^F02 
Large portions of the Stonecrowns are claimed by the goblin-king of Markazor or the Count of Cariele.  In truth, the scattered tribes and brigands who infest these mountains owe loyalty to no king.
^F02 
Stone and mountain giants are known to inhabit the higher reaches of the range, but the monstrous fhoimorien are recognized as far more common and dangerous here.
^F02 
^F11The Sielwode
^F02 
This dark, brooding forest in eastern Anuire is shunned by the folk of Anuire and nearby Brechtur.  It is no place for humans.  Deep in the heart of the forest lies the elf realm of Siellaghriod (see-uh-LEH-ree-od), where the Emerald Queen Isaelie rules a faerie court under the stars.  A few travelers have actually encountered the Emerald Queen's court and returned to tell the tale, but most humans find the woods to be full of menace and impossibly dense and tangled.  Should a traveler persist in trying to find a way through the forest, the elves are likely to make certain that the intruder will not disturb them again.  I have longed to visit this realm, but I realize that such a trip would probably end in my death.
^F02 
^F11Boeruine
^F02 
The largest and most powerful successor-state of the ancient Empire is the Archduchy of Boeruine.  This wide land of deep forests and mountains lies between the Seamists and the Miere Rhuann on Anuire's Western Coast.
^F02 
The archduke Aeric Boeruine rules the land from his fortress of Seaharrow, which overlooks the gray waters of the Sea of Storms.  Aeric claims descent from the line of Roele and represents himself as the heir to the Iron Throne; I find his claim to be a thinly disguised justification for the subjugation of his neighbors.
^F02 
^F11Mhoried
^F02 
Another of the old Twelve Duchies of the Empire is Mhoried, a realm of highlands and moors located at the feet of the Stonecrowns.  Mhoried is a wild, empty land whose rulers avoid the tangled web of alliances and intrigues that absorbs its neighbors.  For many years, the Mhor and his army, the Guardians, have been the Heartlands' first defense against invasions from the north.
^F02 
The scattered folk of Mhoried are herdsmen or freesteaders who look out for themselves.  They're a tougher, more stubborn breed than most people of the Heartlands.  The Mhor's fortress of Bevaldruor (meaning "shield haven" in Old Anuirean) serves as castle and capital.
^F02 
^F11The Seamist Mountains
^F02 
In the southwestern corner of Anuire, the Stonecrowns give way to older, more weathered mountains heavily covered by dense green forest.  The Seamists are named after the great fogs and rain clouds that continually wreathe the mountaintops.  These mountains are closer to the old heartland of Anuire and much more densely populated than the Stonecrowns.  Many woodcutters and miners live in the green valleys and dells of the Seamists, but fierce trolls are also said to lurk in the wilder parts of the range.
^F02 
^F11Ghoere
^F02 
South of Mhoried lies the powerful Barony of Ghoere.  Ghoere has been pivotal in the politics of the successor states since the death of the last Roele.
^F02 
For the last 20 years, the kingdom has been ruled by Gavin Tael, Baron of Ghoere, an ambitious man who makes no secret of his desire for expansion.  He has doubled the kingdom's army and has embarked on a campaign of threats and manipulation against neighboring lands.
^F02 
Tael is advised by the mysterious Sword Mage, a sorcerer of great power.  I would like to know more about this enigmatic wizard and his influence over the baron, but my requests for a meeting have been ignored.
^F02 
^F11River Maesil
^F02 
The greatest river of western Cerilia is the Maesil, which means "old tree" in Old Anuirean.  It is the heart of the old Empire; its mighty flow snakes through seven of the former Twelve Duchies that made up Anuire.  The Maesil is born in the snowmelts of the Stonecrowns and the Iron Peaks, and by the time it flows past Mhoried, it is a half-mile wide.  Hundreds of towns and dozens of cities line its banks; the great city of Anuire straddles its mouth.
^F02 
Even in these darker days, the Maesil carries the bulk of five kingdoms' trade.  Rivermen travel the waters almost constantly, selling passage and cargo space on their brightly painted keelboats.  It's said that there are rivermen who've never set foot on land, but that's just a bard's tale.
^F02 
^F11The City of Anuire
^F02 
The greatest city in all Cerilia is Anuire, the capital of the ancient Empire and the heart of modern Anuirean lands.  This is my home, and even as I pen this manuscript, I can look out over the city from my tower window.
^F02 
While the Iron Throne stands empty, the rulers of the wreckage of the Empire scheme and maneuver for ascendancy in the city, usually causing this metropolis more harm than good.  But the City of Anuire is still a great center for trade and diplomacy, even if it is no longer the center of the world.
^F02 
The city spreads out on both sides of the mouth of the river Maesil, which is more than a mile wide here.  A great seawall guards the Maesil's harbor and dozens of island neighborhoods divided by narrows and canals.  A great rocky tor near the center of the bay is home to the Imperial Palace and my tower.
^F02 
Many of the Imperial bureaucracies and universities still survive in the City of Anuire.  This city is the cultural center of the lands of Anuire, and many great temples and important schools thrive here.  The Royal College of Sorcery located within the city is the only gathering of mages in all Anuirean lands.
^F02 
The City of Anuire lies in the principality of Avanil.  Avanil was known as the Imperial Province in the days of the Empire, but upon the demise of Roele's line, it fell under the control of the Avan family.  Darien Avan is the Prince of Avanil, and although he does not rule the City of Anuire, he has perhaps the greatest influence of any inside its walls.  Avan aspires to the Iron Throne; his campaign of reunification has brought Taeghas and Brosengae under his banner.
^F02 
^F11Roesone
^F02 
Eighty years ago, a remarkable man named Daen Roesone gathered the bandits and brigands of the empty southern lands east of the Spider River and forged them into a brash young kingdom.  Roesone, known as the Black Baron, defied the combined power of the kingdoms of Diemed and Aerenwe for more than four decades before perishing at the hands of his ambitious sons.  A short, violent struggle for power ensued, eventually leaving his youngest son in control.
^F02 
Today, Marlae Roesone, the great-granddaughter of old Daen, is the baroness of Roesone.  Neighboring domains grudgingly recognize the Black Barony of Roesone as a legitimate power.  (I caution my readers not to confuse the Black Baron of Roesone with Raesene the Black Prince!)
^F02 
^F11The Imperial Temple of Haelyn
^F02 
The most powerful and influential temple of the Anuirean lands is the Imperial Temple of Haelyn the Warrior-King.  Haelyn was the noblest and strongest of the new gods who were raised from the destroyed Mount Deismaar; since that day, he has been the patron and protector of Anuire.  The center of the faith is the Golden Temple in the City of Anuire.
^F02 
In the years of strife that followed the death of Michael Roele, the faithful of the Temple became divided as various patriarchs sided with different nobles.  Now, at least a dozen sects of this faith are scattered throughout the lands, as are powerful temples devoted to Cuiraecen, Avanalae, and Nesirie.  In recent years, the rivalries between the temples have erupted into armed conflicts, dragging many kingdoms into fierce religious wars.
^F02 
^F11Straits of Aerele
^F02 
Linking the Sea of Storms to the open waters of the Suidemiere, or Great Sea of the South, the Straits of Aerele are among the most heavily trafficked bodies of water in the world.  It can be a dangerous passage, since the winds and currents are funneled between Cerilia and the northern coast of Aduria.  Nonetheless, many Anuirean and Khinasi traders make the journey routinely.
^F02 
Off the southern coasts of Taeghas, the Seadrake is seen from time to time.  The awnshegh seems to hibernate frequently in a deep, dreamless slumber, as it is sometimes not seen for months at a time.  But when it is awake, it rises to demand tribute from passing vessels.  The Seadrake's lair is rumored to be a vast, treasure-filled grotto hidden in the sea cliffs of the isle of Baerghos.
^F02 
^F11The Erebannien
^F02 
Some people consider this the most beautiful part of Anuire.  The Erebannien is the name of a range of coastal hills, forests, and glens on the shores of the Straits of Aerele.  The woods are warm, green and golden in the sunlight; hidden dells contain clear streams and tiny waterfalls.  It is said that once a person walks the Erebannien in autumn, he leaves a part of his heart there forever.
^F02 
^F05Brechtur
^F02 
Northern Cerilia is divided by a massive inlet of the Thaelasian Sea that separates the jagged peaks of the Spearmarch Range from the ice-crowned Drachenaur Mountains of eastern Cerilia.  This great gulf is called the Krakennauricht (KRAH-ken-NOW-rikt), which is High Brecht for "Kraken's reach," and refers, of course, to the awnshegh.  The Kraken's Reach extends to the shores of Kiergard and Massenmarch in central Cerilia.
^F02 
The rocky shores and narrow fjords of the Krakennauricht are home to the Brechts, a seafaring people who make their living by sealing, whaling, and trading in these icy northern waters.  For many centuries while the Empire was at the peak of its power, the Brecht states were governed by Anuirean viceroys.  When the Gorgon killed the last of the Roeles, Anuirean influence in this region rapidly waned, and the old Brecht bloodlines resurfaced and established independence.
^F02 
Brechtur does not enjoy Anuire's mild climate or rich, prosperous farmlands.  Consequently, the Brecht nations and city-states are smaller than the powers of the south.  Goblins, bandits, and orogs may be only a nuisance in Anuire, but they're a dire threat to the Brechts.  Even in "civilized" regions such as Muden or Grevesmuhl, the lands between towns are wilder and more dangerous than any in Anuire.
^F02 
The sea is vital to the city-states of the Krakennauricht.  Without profitable fishing, sealing, whaling, and trade, these lands would quickly starve.  Winters are hard in northern Brechtur; the mouth of the Krakennauricht freezes over completely, and the miserable weather drives even the boldest captains to port to wait for spring.  In summer, Brecht ships venture to the Anuirean ports of the Miere Rhuann and as far as the Straits of Aerele, and some dare the Leviathan's Reach to call on mysterious eastern ports in the Dragon Isles.
^F02 
^F11The Spearmarch Ranges
^F02 
The western shores of the Krakennauricht are guarded by a stark, snowy wilderness of mountains and glaciers called the Spearmarch Ranges.  These are the highest mountains in Cerilia, with some peaks rising well past 20,000 feet.  In the northern parts of the range, some valleys and passes lie under snow the entire year.  The Hoarfell Mountains in Dauren and the Gorgon's Crown are actually extended ranges of the Spearmarch.
^F02 
The eastern slopes of the Spearmarches are home to a number of Brecht and Rjurik city-states.  These include Hjolvar, Kvigmar, Danigau, Wierech, and Dauren.  The western slopes are empty wilderness under the domination of the goblins of Urga-Zai.  Near the center of the range lie the dark waters of Fhallaghlach (the Lake of Stars).  The dwarven halls of Khurin-Azur are near this ancient lake.
^F02 
^F11The Drachenaur Mountains
^F02 
The Drachenaur Mountains are a barrier of mist-wreathed peaks, deep gorges, and darkly brooding forests.  Giants, trolls, and vicious tribes of orogs infest the region from northernmost Drachenward to southern Berhagen.  On the eastern slopes, the mountains eventually give way to the forests of High Vosgaard.  The Drachenaurs aren't nearly as high as the Spearmarch Ranges, but the lands are broken and more treacherous.
^F02 
The Drachenaurs are named for the legendary dragons (or drachen, in Brecht) that lair along the range.  For whatever reason, the great wyrms rarely venture any deeper into Cerilia; the mountain peaks and mist-filled gorges of this region represent the westernmost habitat of these terrifying creatures.  At least six dragons are known to live in these mountains.
^F02 
^F11Mountains of the Silent Watch
^F02 
Near Berhagen, the Drachenaurs bend south and west to become the Mountains of the Silent Watch.  This lower, less rugged range is heavily forested along its entire length; only a few of the highest peaks actually rise above the timberline.  The mountains are unnaturally still and silent -- all a traveler hears are the faint rumblings of the rivers, streams, and cascades that ramble across the landscape.
^F02 
Although the mountains are relatively low and passable, few travelers attempt the trails of the Silent Watch, for the Banshegh haunts this region.  Fortunately, she is a reclusive creature and her servants and spies are few in number.  The Banshegh ignores most of the foolhardy traders and trappers who venture into the mountains, but every year, a few unfortunates are never seen again.
^F02 
^F11The Coulladaraight
^F02 
This mighty wood once stretched unbroken from the Miere Rhuann to the Sea of Dragons, but with the incursion of humankind and the great wars of Cerilia's past, the forest has retreated.  The Coulladaraight (coo-LAY-da-rahkt) is still one of the greatest woodlands of Cerilia, stretching almost 600 miles along the southern shores of the Krakennauricht.  Many kingdoms and realms lie strewn throughout its green cowl.
^F02 
The name Coulladaraight is elvish for "shadows' deeping"; the local humans often call this area Old Shadowheart.  The Coulladaraight is inconceivably ancient, and vast tracts of the forest are completely unspoiled, especially near the elf realm of Coullabhie.  Travelers often remark at the sense of waiting or watchfulness that lies over the forest's deep ways, as if the trees themselves resented human presence.
^F02 
Near the center of Coulladaraight lies Coullabhie (coo-LAY-vee), a reclusive elven court that shuns contact with its neighbors.  The Coullabhie elves have feuded with the Brechts of bordering Rohrmarch and Rheulgard for hundreds of years in an attempt to prevent further human colonization of the forests.
^F02 
^F11Thuringode Forest
^F02 
Between Massenmarch and Kiergard lies central Cerilia's dark, tangled thicket known as Thuringode Forest.  It has an evil reputation; many bandits and gnolls lurk in its mazes.  Thuringode is home to the Boar of Thuringode, a dim-witted but vicious awnshegh said to be the size of three draft horses and bear tusks like sabres and bristles like rusted iron.  King Wilhelm of Rohrmarch led a hunt for the Boar six years ago; the beast found him first.
^F02 
^F11The Zweilunds
^F02 
Jutting from the coast of Grevesmuhl into the eastern Krakennauricht is a chain of islands known as the Zweilunds (two lands).  They are named for a deceptive formation on Anzlau, the last island in the chain.  Seafarers passing this stretch are often confused by a similar landmark on Uelzau, the next island.  Independent freeholds and pirate dens are scattered throughout the 100-mile chain.
^F02 
^F11The Krakenstaur
^F02 
This rocky peak rises sheer from the waters of the Krakennauricht.  No landings or safe approaches lie along its perimeter, and the nearby waters are plagued by maelstroms and unpredictable currents.  Brecht sailors avoid this spur, believing it to be the home of the Kraken, but no one has seen the creature near this isle.
^F02 
^F11Berhagen
^F02 
The Barony of Berhagen lies between Muden and Rzhlev, wrapped about the Drachenaur Mountains.  The barony is a thinly populated borderland guarded by passes that are closed by weather six months of the year.  Almost all the Berhageners live along the coast of Black Ice Bay; the inland regions are home to only a few remote foresters, hunters, and herdsmen.
^F02 
Berhagen's magnificent forests provide much of the lumber for Muden's shipyards.  Berhagen furs are traded across Cerilia.
^F02 
The baron is Ludwig von Schaeffen, a warrior-prince who must skirmish continually to keep Berhagen's borders from shifting.  The Vos realms of Rzhlev and Molochev have been trying to wrest portions of Berhagen away for more than a century.
^F02 
^F11The Burrows
^F02 
Halflings are rare creatures in Cerilia; this small territory is the only recognized halfling state on the entire continent.  (Halflings are scattered in other parts of Brechtur and Anuire, but they're content to swear loyalty to the local human rulers.) The Burrows maintains good relations and is allied to its neighbors Rheulgard, Coullabhie, and Sendoure.
^F02 
The Burrows is governed by a high council, led by a speaker.  The current speaker is Edvara Garrelban, a wise former adventurer.  She holds the tie-breaking vote if the high council reaches a deadlock.
^F02 
The Burrows maintains a militia of archers and a standing force of constable-soldiers to deal with incursions into halfling territory.  The towns and villages of the Burrows are very defensible, since most of the buildings are linked to each other by underground passages.
^F02 
^F11Daikhar Zhigun
^F02 
Hidden in a high, forested vale of the Drachenaur Mountains are the dwarven cities of Daikhar Zhigun -- the Twin Fortresses.  The Zhigun dwarves have weathered fierce wars against the wyrms and orogs of the Drachenaurs, and they believe in being prepared for war at a moment's notice.  Mighty fortifications and aggressive, heavily-armed patrols guard the Tarik-Khur, or Vale of the Dwarves.  All travelers are stopped and searched at the borders before being escorted to the Twin Fortresses under heavy guard.
^F02 
The Zhigun dwarves engage in little trade, but occasionally hire out mercenary companies of plate-armored axemen.  These elite units are some of the toughest heavy infantry in Cerilia.
^F02 
^F11Danigau
^F02 
Erik Danig, Count of Danigau and heir to the Danig bloodline, rules this western coastland.  He is reputed to be a sorcerer of unsurpassing skill; only his arcane talents have preserved Danigau against the attacks of the Urga-Zai goblins (his neighbors to the west).  The Danigers are a pragmatic people who respect their lord's draconian laws.  Without the martial discipline enforced by the count, the land of Danigau would cease to exist.
^F02 
The Danig bloodline is one of the oldest among the Brechts.  It dates back to Wulf Danig, a hero of Deismaar.  More powerful lines exist in Brechtur, but none have the distinction or character of the Danig family.
^F02 
^F11Grabentod
^F02 
Eighty-five years ago, a pirate-king named Ulrich Graben led a small outlaw fleet from the Zweilunds to the icy, inhospitable lands at the mouth of the Krakennauricht.  He carved out his own kingdom in the shadow of Drachenward.  The folk of the neighboring lands believe to this day that Ulrich made some unholy pact with the Hag for the power to free the land from the savage orog and goblin tribes.
^F02 
Grabentod is a pirate kingdom that preys on traffic passing through the strait.  Its fleets lie concealed in the icy fjords and bays.  Recently, the Royal Fleet of Muden inflicted a punishing defeat on the pirates, scattering them and burning several of their holds.  King Albrecht Graben was taken prisoner and is currently a hostage in the court of Muden.
^F02 
^F11Kiergard
^F02 
Once the most prosperous of the Brecht lands, Kiergard has fallen under the shadow of the Gorgon.  The creature turned its attention eastward after bringing about Anuire's downfall; two hundred years ago, the awnshegh's armies poured out of the mountains and overwhelmed the forces of Kiergard.  Today, Kiergard is a puppet of the Gorgon.
^F02 
The people of Kiergard resent their situation and have rebelled a number of times, but the Gorgon's soldiers have quelled each uprising.  A young captain of Kier blood is rumored to be gathering a resistance again, preparing to liberate Kiergard from its oppressors.
^F02 
^F11Massenmarch
^F02 
On the southern coast of the Krakennauricht lie the highlands and fells of Massenmarch.  Settlers have tried for centuries to tame this land, but a few hundred years ago, a dark champion named Karl Bissel carved a kingdom from the wilds of Massenmarch.  Bissel's bloody reign and deeds have changed him into something both more and less than human.  He now calls himself Swordhawk and leads the gnolls and bandits of Massenmarch in endless skirmishes against the nations around him.
^F02 
^F11The Vampire's Hold
^F02 
Eleven hundred years ago, a young Brecht warrior named Britter Kalt ventured into this dark, brooding valley in the northwestern Coulladaraight to face the awnshegh known as the Sinister.  He slew the creature, but inherited its evil power.  Today, Kalt is the inhuman thing known as the Vampire, and the tangled forests of the vale are his home.
^F02 
^F05Khinasi
^F02 
The southernmost portions of Cerilia are the lands of the Khinasi.  Protected from the bitter winters of Brechtur by high mountains and warm ocean currents, Khinasi enjoys more sun and longer growing seasons than any other region.  In fact, large regions of the Khinasi interior are arid steppes that border on desert.
^F02 
The eastern portion of Khinasi rises into a swath of warm forest and low mountains collectively called the Docandragh, an elvish phrase meaning "heart's wonder." It is a beautiful, wild land of frequent rainfalls, hidden lakes, and magnificent cascades.
^F02  
The plains and forests of Khinasi were once known as Basarji, after the Basarji people who first settled here.  They are not Adurian in origin, as are the Anuireans, Brechts, Rjurik, and Vos; instead, the Basarji colonized these coasts about fifteen hundred years ago, arriving from mysterious lands beyond the Sea of Dragons.  Like the Brechts, the Khinasi are seafarers, merchants, and explorers.
^F02 
While the Anuirean Empire dominated the rest of Cerilia, including western Basarji, eastern Basarji united under the leadership of the great mage-king el-Arrasi, maintaining its independence throughout centuries of Anuirean preeminence.  The phrase khinasi derives from khir-aften el-Arrasi, or "lands under the protection of el-Arrasi." It became the name commonly used by other nations to refer to Basarji lands.
^F02 
The Khinasi realms are strong but small, concentrated around a few fortified cities and ports.  Khinasi culture is exquisitely advanced, with an articulated code of sayim, or face, and great respect for art and literature.  Unfortunately, the Khinasi city-states have been embroiled for hundreds of years in a tangle of feuds, duels, and rivalries that have created a highly political society.
^F02 
Western Khinasi lands include the Harrowmarsh, home of the dreadful Hydra.
^F02 
^F11Sea of the Golden Sun
^F02 
South of Cerilia lies the Great Sea of the South, said to have no far shore.  In Anuire, we know these waters as the Suidemiere; in the Basarji tongue, this mighty ocean is the Bair el-Mehare, or Sea of the Golden Sun.  The southern coasts of Cerilia are far enough north on the globe that the sun appears to rise and set over the waters, as its name might indicate.
^F02 
The Sea of the Golden Sun is the chief highway and battlefield of the Khinasi states.  Thousands of Khinasi dhows ply these waters, fishing and trading along the shores.  The great Khinasi dhouras embark on lengthy voyages from these waters to far, mysterious lands that lie scattered across this shining sea.
^F02 
^F11Sea of Dragons
^F02 
To the east of Cerilia, the Sea of the Golden Sun meets the Sea of Dragons.  The latter is a dangerous, ill-charted body of water subject to confusing mists and fogs; nonetheless, the Basarji crossed the sea in great numbers to reach Cerilia.  The legendary Dragon Isles lie far out to sea, and many fantastic lands are rumored to lie somewhere beyond.  The Khinasi of the east coast domains (Mairada, Min Dhousai, and Merasaf) often venture into these waters, but voyages here are much riskier than in the favorable weather of the Great Sea of the South.
^F02 
^F11Zhainge River
^F02 
The largest river in eastern Cerilia is the Zhainge (jah-EEN-geh), a deep and swift-moving stream originating in the snowmelts of the southern Drachenaurs.  The upper Zhainge flows through Vos lands; in their language, it is called the Tsongya.  Although the Zhainge is navigable for most of its length, trade on the river is light because the Black Spear and Tarvan gnolls are fond of river piracy.  Worse, the western branch of the river winds into the forest of Innishiere, and few boats that enter the woods ever leave.
^F02 
Legends tell that the Zhainge is watched over by a great river-spirit who sometimes aids travelers in danger along its course.
^F02 
^F11Asarwe River
^F02 
This broad, shallow, slow-moving stream forms the southern border of Sendoure, running from the watersheds of the mountains around the Burrows to the vast morass of the Harrowmarsh.  Most of the river is too shallow for seafaring vessels, but a number of barges and scows ply its waters.  The stretch of river that runs through the Sphinx's territory is generally safe; in living memory, the creature has never attacked a vessel on the river.
^F02 
^F11The Fingers of Ayan
^F02 
At the southeastern corner of Cerilia, the land rises abruptly in sharp, knife-edged ranges.  The folk of Mairada and neighboring Khourane call these mountains the Fingers of Ayan, after a legendary hero of Mairada's past.  The mountains are nearly impassable even though the ridges run perpendicular to the coastline; the passes are also extremely steep and choked with dense jungle and boulder-falls.
^F02 
In a high pass of the Fingers of Ayan stands the mysterious Temple of Rilni, where all Khinasi mages must swear their oaths of service or be slain.  On pain of death, no mage may speak of his oath or its conditions except to other mages.
^F02 
^F11Rain Serpent Mountains
^F02 
In the heart of the Docandragh rise the Rain Serpent Mountains, named for a magical and mysterious creature that's said to watch over this land.  The mountains run from the peninsula of Djafra to Lake Ibnoume in the interior of Min Dhousai.  The mountains are inhabited by a rare and reclusive race called the dhoumaire, or "ones who wait." The dhoumaire are not human, but little else is known of them because of their aversion to outsiders.
^F02 
^F11Tarvanian Hills
^F02 
The arid steppes of central Cerilia extend almost 500 miles through the domain of the Sphinx and the Tarvan Waste.  The driest area of the steppes is the Tarvanian Hills, a range of dusty badlands and stony deserts just north of the domains of Aftane and Zikala.  The hills are wild and desolate.  Few humans travel there; a number of ferocious gnoll tribes claim this land and fight over its scarce resources.
^F02 
Everyone in Cerilia knows that the Sphinx's influence extends throughout this region, and that it can command the gnolls at will.
^F02 
^F11Maze of Maalvar
^F02 
Between the mountains and the sea east of Khourane lies the tangled Maze of Maalvar, a trackless and impenetrable region of forest and sheer mountain gorges.  This is the home of Maalvar the Minotaur.  The creature is said to be learned and intelligent, but subject to uncontrollable explosions of bestial rage.  The Minotaur is said to have selected this region as its home to isolate itself from intrusions and visitors who might touch off its savage fits.
^F02 
^F11The Rhuannadaraight
^F02 
The northern reaches of the Docandragh are still known by their elvish name: Rhuannadaraight (roo-ah-NAY-dah-rikt), or "storm's deeping." Cold air from the icy wastes north of Cerilia commonly meets the warm, southern air of Khinasi in this region, producing numerous storms and heavy rains and snowfalls.
^F02 
The western slopes of the Rhuannadaraight are held by the Vos barony of Kozlovnyy.  The eastern foothills are held by the elven domains of Rhuannach and Cwmb Bheinn (koom VEEN).  The elven court of Cwmb Bheinn is extremely reclusive and conceals itself from all travelers and invaders.  No human has ever found it and returned.
^F02 
In the center of the Rhuannadaraight lies the realm of the Lamia.  She is a powerful and malicious awnshegh who constantly seeks to lure travelers into her domain.  The Lamia's hold is a ruined old castle once known as Cravengate; it is defended by hundreds of charmed warriors who have fallen under the Lamia's enchantments.
^F02 
^F11Ariya
^F02 
On a sheltered bay off the Bair el-Mehare stands the white-walled southern city of Ariya.  It is one of the oldest of the Basarji city-states, and is the homeland of the legendary el-Arrasi.  In the long years since the Great King's passing, Ariya's fortunes have declined, but it still possesses moderate strength and influence in Khinasi.
^F02 
Although the realm of Ariya has only one major city, a number of villages and forts under the protection of Ariya are scattered throughout the immediate area.  The Red Kings of Aftane are sworn enemies of Ariya, and the two kingdoms are locked in a bitter struggle for supremacy along the southern coasts.
^F02 
Ariya is ruled by a prince who, by law, must be a paladin of the temple of Avani.  It is not unusual for a reigning prince to formally adopt a promising candidate, or for parents to arrange a marriage of a daughter or son to the next potential ruler.  The power of the prince is opposed by several powerful, self-interested nobles, many of whom maintain mages in their service.
^F02 
^F11Binsada
^F02 
The people of Binsada have largely turned their backs on the sea, and instead exist as ranchers and herdsmen, keeping vast herds of cattle.  There are no true cities in Binsada; the people are scattered in small towns, ranches, and nomadic camps.
^F02 
The capital of Binsada is Ber Dairas, or the Fortress of the East Wind, near the center of the realm.  Roughly 200 years ago, the kings of Binsada hired a company of dwarves from Baruk-Azhik to design and supervise the building of the fortress; consequently, it is among the strongest and most defensible castles in Khinasi.  Unfortunately, the king of Binsada and the dwarves had a misunderstanding about the dwarves' compensation, and the king drove the dwarves out of his capital.  Since that day, the dwarves of Baruk-Azhik have nursed a fierce grudge against Binsada.
^F02 
The current queen of Binsada is Banira, a beautiful and intelligent woman who has proven herself a clever and cagey politician.  Her personal army, the Lions of Dusk, are the finest medium cavalry in Cerilia.
^F02 
^F11Merasaf
^F02 
Merasaf once included the Vos territory known as Yeninskiy as well as the lands held by the Iron Hand Tribes, but the fortunes of war have not favored it.  Today, it is literally a land under siege; it is dependent on the fortified passes at the base of its peninsula to keep the orogs at bay, and it is threatened by ever-bolder sea raids from the Vos across the fjord.
^F02 
Merasaf is ruled by a hereditary defender, who enjoys the rank and privileges of a king.  In Merasaf, the defender's primary duty is the leadership of its army and fleets.  The current defender is Goulan of the Zesande Clan, a silent, severe champion.
^F02 
Merasaf is also watched over by the great mage Turanda.  Turanda has guided Defenders of Merasaf for more than 80 years.  She is a stately, dignified woman who ignores the vanities of youthful appearance, preferring to save her magic for more important issues.
^F02 
^F11Suiriene
^F02 
The island realm of Suiriene is a holdover of the ancient Anuirean Empire.  At the height of its power, an Anuirean viceroy held this island as an Imperial Protectorate.  When the Empire fell, the people of Suiriene (swoo-REEN) declared independence.  About 75% of the population is Basarji, and the balance is of Anuirean descent.  The folk of Suiriene consider themselves one unified people, and their culture combines the best features of Basarji and Anuirean society.
^F02 
Suiriene's army is small, but its fleets are among the most powerful in Cerilia.  Suiriene adheres to a policy of paid neutrality; it rents its fleet to the highest bidder, and thereby decides many of the conflicts on the mainland.
^F02 
^F11Ghamoura
^F02 
South of Khourane in the Bair el-Mehare lies the island kingdom of Ghamoura.  This insular and slightly xenophobic realm falls under the rule of the High Priest of Nasri.  Circles of lesser priests function as court officers, bureaucrats, and officers of the Ghamouran army and navy.  The people of the island are generally happy with the arrangement; before the priests came to power, dozens of competing warlords fought for control of the kingdom.
^F02 
Ghamoura, the Isle of the Serpent, and portions of the southern coasts are littered with mysterious ruins said to belong to the people known as the Masetians.  Scholars and historians still debate the fate of the Masetians, but all agree that they were among the first groups of humans to come to Cerilia.
^F02 
^F11The Zikalan Temple of Avani
^F02 
The dominant religion of Khinasi is the Temple of Avani, Goddess of the Sun and Lady of Reason.  (In Anuire, we know her as Avanalae.) In Khinasi, it is common for a particular temple to be endorsed by the ruler of a land as a state religion.  Few of these state-supported temples get along with each other; thus, the Zikalan Temple of Avani is at odds with the Ariyan Temple of Avani.  A scattering of second-rate temples dedicated to other powers exists in each Khinasi land, but few can compare to the power and prestige of one of the national temples.
^F02 
The Temple of Avani in Zikala is fairly typical of Khinasi religions.  It has held its position of preeminence for several decades and stands high in the councils of the king.  The temple is led by the Exalted High Priestess Shandare, and commands the fearsome Legion of the Blessed Warriors of the Sun -- a private army that rivals any in the land.
^F02 
^F05Rjurik
^F02 
The northwestern region of Cerilia is known as Rjurik.  Most scholars and cartographers mark the Ruide River as the southern boundary of Rjurik, despite the fact that the Anuirean realm of Dhoesone lies north of the river.  The eastern boundary is the slopes of the Spearmarch Ranges of Brechtur.  Most of the Rjurik region is cold forest, downs, and mountains, all sparsely inhabited.
^F02 
Rjurik bears the brunt of the fierce Cerilian winter.  Both spring and autumn are long, wet, and cold, while the brief summer lasts a matter of weeks.  The forests of this region are hardy taiga, or northern pines; the mountains keep their glacial caps the entire year round.
^F02 
The Rjurik themselves are a hardy race of foresters, hunters, and warriors.  Their jarldoms and clanholds are scattered along the forbidding coasts of the Miere Rhuann and the icy northern Thaelasian passage.  A few small holds can be found as far east as the Krakennauricht.  The Rjurik are a free-minded people who place little importance on titles or rulers; a Rjurik jarl reigns by the consent of his folk, and can be replaced if they don't approve of his methods.
^F02 
The Rjurik are suspicious of the Anuireans.  They view Anuire as a sleeping giant who could wake up hungry any day.  In the distant past, the southern Rjurik lands had been incorporated into the Anuirean Empire despite a series of desperate campaigns to resist Anuire's advances.
^F02 
An even greater concern lies in the wild forests and foothills in the center of this region.  Large numbers of goblins, trolls, and giants inhabit these wild lands, and they frequently attack the Rjurik settlements.
^F02 
The scions of the Rjurik bloodlines hold to an uneasy truce most of the time.  Unlike the endless war and competition of the bloodlines in other lands, the heroes of Rjurik find simple survival to be challenge enough.
^F02 
^F11The Silverhead Mountains
^F02 
Weaving through the heart of Rjurik is a low, ice-covered range of peaks known as the Silverheads.  The Silverheads are populated by fierce trolls, small orog-holds, and powerful giants.  A few remote dwarven mines are hidden here.  A handful of mountain herdsmen eke out an existence in these hills, but travelers are warned that this is a wild and dangerous region.
^F02 
^F11The Ruide River
^F02 
Rising from the cold, clear waters of the Fhallaghlach, the Ruide River winds past the Gorgon's Crown and the northern reaches of the Aelvinnwode to the Tael Firth.  The Ruide is swift and dangerous through the Giantdowns, and becomes navigable only under the eaves of the elven domain of Tuarhievel.  The Anuirean merchants from Cariele and Dhoesone use the Ruide as a highway for trade, even though the goblins of Thurazor demand heavy tolls.
^F02 
^F11The Thaelasian Passage
^F02 
North and west of Cerilia lies the icy continent of Thaele, a vast and largely unexplored land of snowfields, stark mountains, and marshy tundra.  Along Thaele's southern coasts, a narrow swath of taiga grows protected by great chains of mountains.  A few Rjurik freeholds and Brecht outposts can be found scattered through this great wilderness.
^F02 
The Thaelasian Passage is the name of the strait separating Cerilia and Thaele.  It is a cold and treacherous stretch of water, menaced by drift ice and fierce, serpentlike sea monsters called unnskrajir.
^F02 
^F11Dhoesone
^F02 
The northernmost outpost of Anuire is Dhoesone, a rough-and-tumble frontier barony.  Hundreds of years ago, Dhoesone was the mustering-point for Anuirean expeditions into the Rjurik lands, but with the decline of Anuire and the organization of Rjurik kingdoms, the invasions are a thing of the past.  Today, Dhoesone attempts campaigns of a different sort -- those involving economic conquests.  The barony is booming with influxes of timber, furs, and northern gold from trade with the Rjurik jarldoms.
^F02 
Dhoesone's people are Anuirean, but like the highlanders of Mhoried, they consider themselves a tougher, more practical breed.  The barony is ruled by Lady Fhiele Dhoesone, but rumors of the baroness's weakness in the face of the powerful trade guilds are all too common.
^F02 
^F11The Giantdowns
^F02 
Much of central Rjurik is covered by wild, barren highlands that slope northward to meet the foothills of the Silverheads.  This area is known as the Giantdowns.  In truth, a relatively small number of giants live here; most of the inhabitants are sturdy freeholders, bandits, or gnoll tribes.  But enough hill giants and fhoimorien make appearances to keep the Gorgon's armies on the southern bank of the Ruide River.
^F02 
^F11Halskapa
^F02 
The strongest of the Rjurik domains is the western kingdom of Halskapa, meaning "iron cape" in the Rjuven language.  The capital, Skapa Hjarring, is the largest town north of Dhoesone and one of the busiest ports in western Cerilia.
^F02 
Halskapa's strength stems from a union of clan jarls who swear fealty to its king.  Unlike most other Rjurik leaders, Halskapa's king can field a considerable army and is wealthy enough to maintain castles and services such as tax collectors and a force of police for the larger towns.
^F02 
Halskapa is currently ruled by King Bervinig, an aging ruler who has seen much of his power slip away to the independent town councils.  Bervinig has no children, and a vicious little succession struggle is brewing.
^F02 
^F11The Blood Skull Barony
^F02 
The Blood Skull orogs are an unusually powerful and dangerous coalition that threatens all other realms nearby.  About 10 years ago, the orogs suffered a major defeat in Rjuvik, but their numbers are growing again.  Orog raiders and scouts have been seen from Hogunmark in the north to Stjordvik in the south.
^F02 
^F11Rjuvik
^F02 
Between Halskapa and Dhoesone lie three Rjurik realms known as Stjordvik, Rjuvik (RYOO-vik), and Svinik.  Of these, Rjuvik is the most noteworthy -- it is ruled by a bandit prince named Fulgar the Bold.  Fulgar takes a great interest in the expanding trade with the south, and his housecarls and clan lords (a court of cutthroats and thieves if ever there was one) go to great lengths to acquire as much Anuirean gold as possible.
^F02 
^F05Vosgaard
^F02 
The most desolate and remote region of Cerilia is called Vosgaard.  It comprises the northeastern reaches of the land beyond the Drachenaur Mountains and north of the Rhuannadaraight (roo-ah-NAY-dah-rikt).  The cold waters of the Leviathan's Reach form the northern border of Vosgaard.  East of this land lie the stormy waters of the Sea of Dragons.
^F02 
Vosgaard is a land of stark natural beauty made up of impassable mountains and glaciers, vast belts of taiga, and bitter wind-swept plains.  Much like the Rjurik lands, Vosgaard suffers from extremely cold winters and is haunted by monsters of all varieties.  Life is difficult and violent in the lands of the Vos.  Consequently, they are a fierce, battle-ready people who believe that might makes right.
^F02 
The other human races of Cerilia tend to view the Vos as evil barbarians, savages, and marauders, but this isn't entirely true.  The Vos have their cities and kingdoms, with heroes of noble bearing among them.  It is important to remember that, by their own standards, Vos warriors are acting with honor when they raid and pillage the lands of the Brechts or the Basarji.  And, while no one will ever accuse a Vos of subterfuge or subtlety, it's also true that an opponent always knows where he stands against a Vos warrior.
^F02 
The code of courage and violent tendencies of Vos warriors and rulers have made northeastern Cerilia a battlefield for settling Vos differences and feuds.  The Vos hold "weaker" cultures in contempt, and they view the other peoples of Cerilia as potential slaves or enemies, but the Vos tribes absolutely hate each other.  Travelers in Vosgaard should go to great lengths to avoid associating themselves with any particular chieftain or baronet -- it is dangerous to take sides, even by placing oneself under a chieftain's protection.
^F02 
^F11The Orlenaskyy Mountains
^F02 
The Orlenaskyy Mountains are said to be named after a great hero of old who slew a dragon on a high icefield but perished along with his foe.  The name means "Orl's home" in Vos.  This barren range of sheer, razor-edged peaks and great glacial fields acts as a windbreak for the lands to the south.  The bitterly cold weather of Vosgaard tends to stall to the north of this mountain range.
^F02 
The center of the Orlenaskyy range is home to the Swordrust Tribes, a small but fierce nation of orogs that raids all nearby lands.  The tribes are led by the great warrior-chief Tolzimkur, a canny old survivor of legendary skill and strength.
^F02 
^F11The Leviathan's Reach
^F02 
The mighty Leviathan is said to swim the waters of this passage between northeastern Cerilia and the uninhabited island of Torova Temylatin.  The seas north of the great island are ice-choked most of the year; captains sailing east or west along Cerilia's northern coast have no other choice but to attempt the Leviathan's Reach.  Fortunately, the awnshegh known as the Leviathan has not been seen or heard from in many years.
^F02 
^F11Lake Ladan
^F02 
Several hundred years ago, an alliance of Brecht kingdoms mounted a great expedition into Vosgaard, seeking to pacify or destroy the Vos chieftains.  At first, they had great success, but the legendary Tsarevic Basil Zariyatam created a short-lived Vos Federation to stop the invasion.  The two armies met on the frozen surface of Lake Ladan in central Vosgaard and annihilated each other in one of the bloodiest days since Deismaar.  The Tsarevic perished in the fight, but it's said in Vosgaard that he sleeps under the waters of the lake, waiting until the day he is needed again.
^F02 
^F11Grovnekevic Forest
^F02 
In Vos, the word grovnek means "giant." This great northern forest stretches for hundreds of miles across northeastern Cerilia.  Its uncharted depths and wilds are home to a number of reclusive forest and hill giants, tribes of orogs and gnolls, dangerous elves, and adventurous human settlers.
^F02 
The heart of the forest is the elf domain of Tuar Annwn (twahr an-NOON), a gloomy place along the shores of the Annwnalach, or Lake of Silence.  The elves of Tuar Annwn mourn the end of elvenkind and fight fiercely against the encroachment of humans, orogs, and gnolls into their domain.  It is certain death for a human to set foot in this part of the forest.
^F02 
^F11Kal Kalathor
^F02 
The strongest goblin kingdom in Cerilia is Kal Kalathor, a barren, wind-swept steppeland south of Lake  Ladan.  Goblins are the most organized of Cerilia's darker inhabitants; unlike the chaotic orogs or gnoll bands, goblins make a show of coexisting with their neighbors.  Goblin lords are slaveholders; goblin warriors are an elite class who exist on the labor of thousands of slaves and prisoners.
^F02 
Kal Kalathor is ruled by a weak chieftain controlled by the goblin shamans.  The individual chieftains and captains of Kal Kalathor are engaged in a bitter struggle for power in the absence of a strong king.
^F02 
^F11Kozlovnyy
^F02 
The southernmost Vos kingdom is Kozlovnyy, a land once held by Khinasi herdsmen.  Kozlovnyy was seized by an ambitious Vos warlord several centuries ago and has remained in Vos hands ever since.  Surprisingly, the Vos of Kozlovnyy have been greatly influenced by the nearby Brecht and Khinasi peoples; they possess a higher level of civilization and culture than their kinsmen to the north.  The Vos of Kozlovnyy don't hold slaves, they resolve feuds and duels by a system of nonlethal challenges, and they forbid the worship of the dark, violent Vos deities.  Kozlovnyy is ruled by a capable warrior-baron.
^F02 
^F11The Raven
^F02 
Once known as the Vos warlord Pyotr Tusilov, the Raven is a powerful awnshegh who controls a Vos barony between Yeninskiy on the eastern coast and Kal Kalathor.  Pyotr Tusilov was a mighty warrior of the blood who fought his way to supremacy through cruel savagery and a fiendish cunning.  He encourages tests of strength, feuds, and eternal warfare in the land, winnowing out the strongest and most ruthless for his agents.
^F02 
^F11Rovninodensk
^F02 
Rovninodensk (rov-NEE-no-densk) is home to the greatly-feared Vos varsks, or riding-lizards.  The cold plains north of Lake Ladan are the natural habitat of the creatures, and the Vos of Rovninodensk exist by raising these fierce war-mounts and trading them to nearby kingdoms.  The varsk cavalry of Rovninodensk are the finest soldiery in all Vosgaard.  The Boyar Andrei Tcherninsky is master of this land.

^F02 
^F06Background of the Anuire World
^F02 
^F06Introduction
^F02 
Jagged bluffs stand sentinel before a harsh Cerilian coastline.  Waves strike the rocks and send a salty spray shooting high into the air.  The fragrant woods beyond seem to beckon, tiny towns occasionally peeking out from the foliage.  The thick forest eventually gives way to rolling hills, which grow into snowcapped peaks.  Around them, a land of grandeur unfolds: the land of Anuire.
^F02 
This dominion, comprising the southwestern corner of the continent of Cerilia on a world called Aebrynis, certainly holds its share of wonders.  The mighty river Maesil wanders down from the deep northern forest, flowing past farm and field -- and past the blackened battle sites that mar the Heartlands.  Although the land attempts to heal itself after each new war, some scars never mend.  Ultimately, the Maesil rushes through a grand city that stretches across an entire string of islands connected by an intricate network of bridges and ferries.  The ruins just outside this city still smolder 500 years after the explosion that leveled the college of sorcery there.  Within the manmade borders crisscrossing this landscape stretches the land called Anuire, the Ruins of Empire.
^F02 
Between the Silverhead Mountains to the north and the Straits of Aerele in the south, and the Tael Firth to the west and the Gulf of Coeranys in the east, lie the more than 350,000 square miles that comprise Anuire.  And nearly every inch of every one of those miles is claimed by one regent or another.
^F02 
Thirty kingdoms fall within these lands, each covering as much territory as its ruler can hold.  Still, there's no shortage of land for someone with the ambition and the ability to conquer.  The war-torn landscape has seen many would-be conquerors, but none ever again like Roele, the man who forged the vast Anuirean Empire across Cerilia so long ago.
^F02 
^F06How to Use This Information
^F02 
Ruins of Empire describes the kingdoms and people of Anuire.  It's best to read the Atlas of Cerilia first, followed by the Birthright rules for playing the computer game, to gain an understanding of this campaign setting.  
^F02 
Of the domains described, some are more suitable than others for player characters (PCs) to rule.  For instance, kingdoms like Ghoere, Mhoried, and Boeruine provide strong antagonists or allies for the PCs -- they make better nonplayer character (NPC) domains.  Kingdoms like Roesone and Tuornen offer enough background for players to pick up immediately, rather than establishing new domains of their own within existing borders.
^F02 
The second part contains descriptions of some of the most important and colorful characters in Anuire.  This scenario demonstrates how to integrate the domain turn and domain actions into the course of an adventure and can help launch a campaign in this new world.
^F02 
^F06Anuire
^F02 
One can divide Anuire into five distinct regions:  its Southern and Western Coasts, the Heartlands, and the Northern and Eastern Marches.  Each has its own clear personality.
^F02 
^F05The Southern Coast
^F02 
The most civilized area of Anuire, the South, has been settled longer than the new gods have enjoyed their heavenly thrones.  Few places here have escaped takeover by humankind.
^F02 
As the residents can attest, the area is full of excitement and sites of interest.  Old castles hide a wealth of information about the Anuire of days past.  The Straits of Aerele just to the south are home to the feared Seadrake, while the Spiderfell to the north houses another abomination.  And places of mystery still remain: the Erebannien in Aerenwe as well as domains -- such as Mieres -- whose dark secrets have rendered them all but lost to the rest of the land.
^F02 
^F05The Western Coast
^F02 
More savage than the South, the West feels the lash of fierce storms off the Miere Rhuann (Sea of Storms).  The locals, most of whom make their livings fishing and farming, regard the storms as divine tests of character and face the winds and waves with grim fortitude.  Though Haelyn remains their patron deity, they also revere Cuiraecen and Nesirie.
^F02 
The Western land is wooded and rocky, with jagged mountains to the east.  The air feels constantly chilly, and fog regularly rolls in from the sea.  One might expect locals to be as gloomy as their land: Not so.  Once the workday ends, they give themselves over to mirth, for only rarely do they face hardships beyond the storms.  One awnshegh, Rhuobhe the Elf, lives nearby, but he seems more intent on destroying kings than peasants.
^F02 
The Aelvinnwode runs through the coastal areas, but there's little danger of the gheallie Sidhe (the Elven Hunt) from even the most human-hating elves.  Those elves who have not withdrawn to Tuarhievel or the Sielwode attack the gnoll and goblin populations that plague the West.
^F02 
^F05The Heartlands
^F02 
The most fertile area of Anuire also contains the old Imperial Capital: the City of Anuire.  Kings have fought to control this city for centuries, so the Heartlands region has seen battles too numerous to count.  Everyone still wants control of the area's resources, but many don't wield enough power -- and most can survive without the bounty of the Heart.
^F02 
The Heartlands comprises mostly rolling farmland dotted with crags and bluffs.  Lakes and rivers appear here and there, though not in such profusion as in the East.  Despite the occasional patch of swamp or moor, the land here looks well kept and cultivated.
^F02 
Yet places exist where no grasses grow, where bare earth and rocks lie open to the sky like a festering wound.  These are the battlefields of the Heart, where great hosts still meet to decide the fate of kingdoms.  Some rulers realize the folly of destroying in war the very places they're fighting for, so they agree to marshall their armies where death already has been dealt.  Of course, not everyone honors this policy.
^F02 
^F05The Northern Marches
^F02 
The Northern Marches are the most dangerous and least civilized part of Anuire.  This area is home to only two kingdoms from the old Empire, for the land seems hostile to civilization.  Dhoesone and Cariele lie nearly surrounded by inimical forces.
^F02 
Dhoesone borders three nonhuman lands, as well as Stjordvik of the Rjurik.  Cariele shares its borders with four nonhuman realms.  Life in these lands is uncertain and nearly as brutal as in neighboring Vosgaard -- the nobles and rulers here have little time to waste on pleasantries and pleasures.  They must instead save their energies for the unceasing battles against enemies on all sides.
^F02 
^F05The Eastern Marches
^F02 
A traveler's first impression of the Eastern Marches is one of dampness.  There is water everywhere, from the swamps of Osoerde to the rivers of Coeranys.  Most who live here become bargemen or fisherfolk, though some farming and woodcutting goes on, too.  The people act fairly civilized and relaxed and could become excellent politicians, so adept are they at hiding their true feelings.  However, most have no desire to venture into politics -- they just want to live as they please.
^F02 
^F06The Anuirean Book of Days
^F02 
Time is measured differently depending on where in Cerilia one happens to be.  The Brechts measure time by tide and moon, while the Khinasi track the passage of days, months, and years by the position of the sun.  The Vos generally don't care about the days or months -- they measure time by the naming of years, with the first snowfall after a brief summer beginning a new year.
^F02 
Anuireans (and Rjuriks, forced long ago to accept their method) use the Book of Days, which they base on the orbit of the moon and the movement of the constellation of Haelyn, the protector.  This book defines 12 months to a year, four weeks to a month, and eight days to a week.  A year has 388 days.
^F02 
The four annual days not part of any month have become times to celebrate and reflect.  These days fall on the vernal equinox (the Day of Rebirth), the summer solstice (the Night of Fire, when a shower of falling stars results from annual passage through a meteor belt at the climax of Haelyn's Festival), the autumnal equinox (the Veneration of the Sleeping), and the winter solstice (the Eve of the Dead).
^F02 
^F05The Crown of Glory
^F02 
The noble warrior god Haelyn is the protector and brother to Roele, the founder of the Anuirean Empire.  Naturally, the astronomers based in the City of Anuire in those long-ago days chose the constellation of Haelyn to help them measure time.  This constellation, six stars high, looks like a warrior engarde and is fully visible from southern Anuire at the summer solstice.  With each passing month after this solstice, one more star slips below the southern horizon.
^F02 
When the last star -- Haelyn's head, or the Crown of Glory -- falls beneath the horizon, the Eve of the Dead has come.  Haelyn hides only for the single night of the winter solstice, but it's a night of frantic prayer, for many fear the Shadow World's influence grows strongest when Haelyn's constellation does not watch over his people.  Of course, Anuireans living farther north must endure even more time away from Haelyn's gaze.  As protection from the Shadow World, many in the North also venerate the Rjurik god, Aeric.
^F02 
^F05Months, Days, and Years
^F02 
The 12 months of the Anuirean calendar begin with the Day of Rebirth, the vernal equinox.  The month Sarimiere is the first of the new year, followed by Talienir, then Roelir.  After Haelyn's Festival, the month of Haelynir begins.  Anarire and Deismir (named for the Godswar's final battle) follow in succession, with the Veneration of the Sleeping next.  Erntenir, the month of harvest, leads to Sehnir, then Emmanir, just before the Eve of the Dead.  Then comes the coldest month, Keltier, which flows into Faniele, then Pasiphiel, and again, the Day of Rebirth.
^F02 
Anuireans devote six of the week's eight days to work, giving the remainder over to leisure.  The days, from work's beginning to rest's end, are: Firlen, Relen, Dielen, Varilen, Branlen, Barlen, Mierlen, and Taelen.
^F02 
Almost 2,000 years after the destruction of the old gods, Anuire's current yearly reckoning is 551 Michaeline (551MR), or 551 years after the death of Michael Roele, last Emperor of Anuire.  In Khinasi lands, the year is 2039 MA (dating from the Masetian Arrival  in Cerilia).  In certain other parts of Cerilia, the year is 1524 HC (Haelyn's Count), recording the years since the battle of Mount Deismaar.
^F02 
^F06How to Read a Kingdom
^F02 
The Birthright campaign setting defines the word kingdom fairly broadly as a political domain ruled by a blooded noble.  This ruler can actually be a count, high priest, duke, etc., but his people may still call him king.
^F02 
This book presents kingdoms in two ways: one including just the domain's basic information or one containing an entire spread for greater detail.  The shorter entries use a briefer form of the format detailed below.
^F02 
Note:	If no game statistics appear for a figure mentioned in the description, consider that NPC a 0-level, unblooded character.
^F02 
Alignment:	How does the kingdom handle its neighbors and internal affairs? A lawful good domain tries to open diplomatic relations between lands, seeking the best for all.  However, a chaotic evil kingdom considers alliances merely means to dominate another land.
^F02 
Status:	Can player characters run this kingdom, or is it controlled by one of the main NPCs of Anuire? A domain's status is either recommended or not available for PCs.
^F02 
Provinces/Holdings:	For each domain, a chart presents the provinces that make up the kingdom and shows who controls the domain's holdings.  Each parenthetical rating given for a province is split -- for example, Rivenrock (5/4) -- to signify the province rating and the magical rating (in the above example, 5 and 4, respectively).  Specific levels are given for the four types of holding, unless the domain is mostly unexplored.
^F02 
	Law:	Who owns the law holdings of the kingdom, and in which provinces?

^F05Anuirean Noble Titles
^F02 
In the days of the Anuirean Empire, a noble's title reflected his rank.  Princes owed fealty to the Emperor, (arch)dukes to a prince, barons to a duke, and counts to a baron.  (Elf and other realms use titles like king, queen, and prince that have no ties to Imperial ranks.) Princes ruled vast domains as members of the Imperial family, while dukes ruled one of the Twelve Duchies; both principalities and duchies held up to a dozen or so provinces.  Baronies of old were quite a bit smaller -- usually only three or four provinces.  A count held only one province.
^F02 
However, this picture has changed dramatically since the death of Michael Roele.  With the Empire's collapse, many barons and counts won independence from their overlords or conquered enough land to forge domains for themselves that rivaled the duchies.  This trend explains why the Baron of Ghoere today governs more land than the only remaining true Prince, Darien Avan.
^F02 
These days, a regent's noble title does little more than reflect the heritage of his kingdom.  (That's why no one should refer to Gavin Tael, Baron of Ghoere, as "Baron Tael" or "Baron Gavin." The Baron of Ghoere is a historical title, not part of a name.) Today, others accord a ruler status not based on whether he is a count, duke, or thane, but by his influence and the strength of his lands.
^F02 
^F06The Realms of Anuire
^F02 
^F06The Southern Coast
^F02 
The sun shines, gentle and constant, on the Southern Coast of Anuire.  It caresses the waves dividing the province of Mieres from the rest of the region, and it dances upon the Erebannien, a forest that has stolen the hearts of many.
^F02 
This coastal area, the first part of Cerilia settled by humans, boasts some of the oldest culture on the continent -- barring, of course, that of the native elves, dwarves, and goblins.  The region remains one of Cerilia's most civilized and developed today.  Unfortunately, the chaos of the 500 years since the death of Michael Roele has destroyed many of the marvels of times long gone, and locals have lost much ancient wisdom and skill.
^F02 
^F06Today on the Southern Coast
^F02 
	Explorers have been seeking and finding ruins more than a millennium old, and emerging from these lost cities with knowledge and treasure.  The more superstitious (or more prudent) people fear that investigating the ancient ruins might disturb a power better left asleep.  Some have even gone so far as to post watches around these ruins, set to thrash intruders to ensure that whatever lies beneath remains buried.
^F02 
	The Book of Days, kept under lock and key at the Imperial Conservatory in the City of Anuire, holds the secrets of the heavens and earth, some say.  Many have died to possess this book, reputedly the most powerful arcane tome in Cerilia.  Skeptics call it valuable merely because it contains knowledge unavailable to the common man -- no other book can equal it.
^F02 
	But it's been stolen.  Rumors place the Book of Days somewhere in the domain of Ilien, Roesone, or Aerenwe now -- perhaps even taken to the heart of the Erebannien.  The Imperial College of Astronomy has offered a hefty reward for its return, though officials there hope someone will be altruistic enough to return it without demanding the ransom.
^F02 
	Rumors of war are winging their way across the Southern lands, and indeed all of Anuire.  The armies of Roesone stand poised to repel an attack by Ghoere to the north, and folks have seen the rangers of Aerenwe emerging from the Erebannien to gather militia.  While Ilien fortifies, the kingdoms of Diemed and Medoere rattle their swords at each other across their border.  With the season of war almost upon Anuire again, the main contenders for the Iron Throne marshal their forces for another try at the ultimate prize: rulership of a reunified Anuirean Empire.
^F02 
	Bandits in Diemed have started harrying caravans bound for other kingdoms.  Though Heirl Diem, Baron of Diemed has sent out numerous patrols to intercept these bandits, his soldiers have found nothing.  Could these patrols actually belong to the bandit king's forces as well as the baron's? Perhaps there are no bandits, simply caravaneers who want their goods for themselves.  Or maybe the one robbing the caravans is the mysterious wizard living in the southern mountains.
^F02 
	Lately, Medoere has faced some trouble from the Spider, stirring again in the Spiderfell after decades of quiet.  Small bands of gnolls have crept from the wood to burn nearby steadings of humans or to pillage crops in Caerwil.  Slaughtered bodies have been found in the smoking ruins of farmhouses, and parties of foresters have vanished with no trace.  Whether this spells the beginning of a war, or simply a tactic to lure Ghoere or Roesone into relaxing their border watch along the Spiderfell, it still means trouble for the struggling theocracy of Medoere.
^F02 
	According to new reports, ships regularly unload scores of warriors on the shores of the Erebannien in Roesone and Aerenwe.  If true, this story means that some unknown power is violating the traditional neutrality of the Erebannien.  Is it an Anuirean kingdom, or one from another part of Cerilia? The trespassers might even be shiploads of fighters from the ancient southern lands! In any case, the rangers of the Erebannien likely can't muster numbers enough to hold all the invaders at bay.
^F02 
	The Seadrake, rearing its ugly head again in the Straits of Aerele to the south, has begun demanding tribute from passing ships and destroying coastal villages.  Strangely, it has been leaving the pirates of Mieres alone, allowing these humans to claim their own bounty.

^F02 
Regency Generated/Accumulated:	30/56 RP.
Treasury:	15 GB.
^F02 
Army
Roesone's army, though not as large as that of its northern neighbor, Ghoere, remains sizable enough to give the nearby kingdoms pause before they consider moving in.  The army consists of:
	3 units of archers.
	1 unit of knights.
	3 units of pikemen.
	1 unit of infantry.
^F02 
Regent:	Marlae Roesone (FA; F5; Br, major, 24; N)
The kingdom has a baroness, Marlae Roesone (FA; F5; Br, major, 24; N).  The great-granddaughter of the Black Baron grew up hearing how her grandfather, Morghan, may have slain Daen Roesone, his own father, for the rule of the domain.  She shares a few of her violent grandfather's traits, tempered by a touch of mercy and compassion.  However, she understands certain political necessities, and she'll go to any length to defend her kingdom.
^F02 
Though a stern ruler, the baroness knows what her people need.  Her fair and unyielding justice applies to the roughest of the peasants and the most polished of the nobles alike.  Her people feel no great love for her, but neither do they find her taxes and her laws too oppressive.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Marlae Roesone considers herself capable of managing her kingdom on her own.  However, this feeling may change soon.  With Diemed constantly scheming and Ghoere on the northern border, it's only a matter of time before she starts looking for skilled lieutenants to lend her able aid.  One such candidate is Michael Agnelie, (MA; T3: Br, tainted, 10; LG), the mayor of the city of Proudglaive.  He is a bluff, friendly sort and intensely devoted to the baroness.  There are rumors that link him romantically with Marlae Roesone, but there has never been any proof of such a liason.
^F02 
Important NPCs
The mayor of the capital, a blooded man named Michael Agnelie, (MA; T3: Br, tainted, 10; LG) appears to be an amiable man who spendsa great deal of his time working on the interests of the baroness.  Gossip persists about a romantic affair, but facts of such are missing.
^F02 
The noble families of Roesone all appear ambitious: eager to improve themselves at the expense of others.  Within this mostly friendly rivalry exists a certain tension among some families.  The Isilvieres and Bellamies, both descended from old Daen Roesone's lieutenants, fiercely attempt to best the others.  Their petty competition hasn't broken into outright fighting, but that day may not be far off.
^F02 
Description
Grasslands and farms cover Roesone's landscape, and occasional bogs and hills dot its surface.  Few of the towns scattered throughout the kingdom rise above 500 in population.  Southern Roesone holds a bit of the Erebannien, the loveliest wood in Anuire.  Though plenty of trading guilds would love to log this land, none would dare defy the baroness (officially, at least) or the rulers of the other realms covered by the Erebannien.
^F02 
Most people of Roesone possess a frontier mentality.  The lands here, sparsely settled when Daen Roesone brought them under his banner, have attracted new settlers to rediscover its beauty.  They come from all over Anuire, uprooted by wars and troubles, and have come to Roesone to build new lives.  Therefore, they tend to stick together and do not stand bullying from newcomers; one family's problems often end thanks to the efforts of friends.  The folks of Roesone share an interest in exploration -- many famous adventurers once called this land home.
^F02 
Abandoned castles crumble into ruin all over the land, remnants of a time before the Empire fell and neighbor turned on neighbor for a chance at the Iron Throne.  Much of still-wild Roesone lacks the trappings of civilization, but as the land becomes more and more settled, the ruins are rebuilt and the country grows to resemble the lands around it.  In a few years, it seems likely that there will be no more lost fortresses to find in the hills.
^F02 
Capital
The capital of Roesone is in the province of Caercas, which borders on Ilien and Medoere.  This city, Proudglaive, takes its name from the armies who fought and died in the wars that brought about the birthing of Roesone.  Its population of about 10,000 comprises humans, elves, dwarves, and halflings.  The people seem friendly but guarded and quick to judge those who would deal with them.
^F02 
Trade Goods
The farms of Roesone produce grains -- barley, wheat, and corn are the staples of trade in the realm.  One also can find many herds of cattle and fields of cotton.  Textiles become more common in the southern provinces, while the northern provinces tend toward agriculture.  Trade routes lie between Proudglaive and Ilien and run from Bellam to Shieldhaven in Mhoried.
^F02 
Allies
Ilien and Medoere have tied their fortunes to those of Roesone, and the baroness aids the smaller domains.  As all three are new kingdoms -- at least, compared to those around them -- the rulers have learned to trust each other as much as regents can trust one another.
^F02 
Enemies
Though Ghoere's armies frequently "wander" across the border into Roesone, there's no real enmity there.  The only true animosity toward the baroness comes from the ruler of Diemed, who has regained some of the strength lost by his ancestors.  Though he has not declared war on Roesone, everyone knows he devoutly desires the return of all lands that used to lie under Diemed's purview.
^F02 
The baroness, well aware of Heirl Diem's desires, spends much of her time trying to uncover his plots and untie the threads of conspiracy he has woven to regain these lands.  She has cunningly enlisted the assistance of the Aerenwean queen's lieutenants, who subtly aid her against Diemed's machinations.
^F02 
Special Conditions
The Erebannien dominates Abbatuor, the southern province of Roesone.  For more information, see Aerenwe.
^F02 
One of the baroness's blood abilities allows her to see through the eyes of cats; thus, she has decreed it a crime to harm felines in this land.  The severity of the punishment depends on the extent of the harm done to the cat.

^F02 
Regent:	Queen Liliene Swordwraith (FA; R10; An, major, 37; NG)
An indirect descendant of Roele, Liliene Swordwraith (FA; R10; An, major, 37; NG), is Queen of Aerenwe.  She rose from obscurity in one of the forgotten towns of the domain, winning the favor of the people away from the harsh king before her.  Eventually, she deposed the tyrant and forced the kingdom into modern times.
^F02 
The aged queen is wise and respected and has the absolute loyalty of her people.  They're all willing to give their lives in defense of her kingdom.  If she asked, they would march into even the Gorgon's lair.  However, she has no designs on expanding her kingdom; Liliene Swordwraith and her people feel content with their corner of the land.
^F02 
Lieutenants
The queen places much of the burden of rulership on Cole Alwier (M1/2E; F/M 4/4; Re, minor, 15; CG), one of her twins.  He and his sister Cale left the safety of the Aelvinnwode to follow the Queen back to Aerenwe.  The queen trusts him implicitly, and some say the two of them have been running the kingdom for years now.  They also provide some aid to the embattled Baroness of Roesone against Diemed's incursions, for a reason known only to them.
^F02 
Important NPCs
The Eastern Temple of Nesirie controls all the temples of Aerenwe, and the High Mage Aelies (M1/2E; W16; Vo, major, 36; LN) has overseen the magic of the seven provinces for hundreds of years.  The Erebannien keeps him young even for a half-elf; it's one of the few places where the magic of old Cerilia flows unchanged, tapped only by this ancient wizard.  Aelies competes with Rogr Aglondier, Count of Ilien, for the magical essence from the wood, as he has competed with the Aglondiers for centuries.  Calrie has only a tiny guild, run by Mourde Alondir (MA; T1; Ma, minor, 15; LN), a guildmaster looking to forest in the Erebannien.  The rest of the domain's guild holdings are managed by Siele Ghoried.
^F02 
Provinces
Four provinces fall within the Erebannien, called the most beautiful forest in Cerilia.  The capital, Calrie, is marked by the castle Caer Callin (6).
^F02 
Description
Aerenwe is the least developed of the Southern Coast's domains.  It has swamps in the northeast and the Erebannien bordering the ocean the rest of the way around its perimeter.  The interior terrain -- verdant grassland -- stays farmed and fenced.  Aerenweans keep to their own business -- but they know their neighbors, and they will defend their companions to their dying breaths.  Though solitary, they are fiercely loyal.
^F02 
Aerenweans inhabit only three of the seven provinces, and they don't want to destroy their land through war as some other Anuirean kingdoms have done.  It is well that Aerenwe's neighbors feel the same.  No army has ever marched through the Erebannien, and none from Anuire ever will.  Any ruler who would despoil the shady trails of the forest would see his allies turning into enemies and his enemies raving for his blood.  An unspoken truce among the Anuireans ensures the protection of the Erebannien from war.  Unfortunately, other parts of Aerenwe have felt the bite of conflict.
^F02 
Folks say a group of bandits has hidden out in the depths of the forest; yet, no one has produced any evidence.  Some think the interlopers are elves, while others call the whole story a lie.  No one knows that it's really a band of the queen's finest rangers watching over the grand forest.  Despite the unspoken truce to safeguard the wood, the regent doesn't take chances.
^F02 
The domain comprises eight settlements.  Scattered throughout the country, these towns have an average population of 3,000, though about 5,000 people live in the shadow of Caer Callin.  Not only does everyone in the kingdom train for the militia, quite a few retired adventurers and mercenaries dwell in fair Aerenwe.  All of them will muster willingly, if it comes to war.

^F02 
Regent:	Heirl Diem (MA; F7; Br, major, 42; LN)
Diemed's warrior baron, Heirl Diem (MA; F7; Br, major, 42; LN), is a direct descendant of the founder of Diemed.  Those who deal with this canny politician and cunning strategist realize most of his actions have a secret motivation or form part of a trick; sometimes the baron uses this reputation to his advantage by doing exactly what he claims, and nothing more.  For this reason, other regents fear engaging in diplomatic relations with him -- they don't know what he intends, and they have few chances to find out before he's succeeded.
^F02 
The baron seeks perfect order in his kingdom and allows no lawbreaker to go unpunished.  His justice is fair and even-handed, though, extending from the lowliest commoner to his own family.  The punishments vary not in the slightest depending on social class.  The baron does not believe in exceptions.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Diem has at least four trusted lieutenants who constitute an extensive spy network, in both his own and neighboring kingdoms.  His secret sources allow him to quickly respond to internal threats or external pressures with a minimum of inconvenience.  Some say his own daughter, Lasica Diem (FA; W5; Br, major, 42; LN), works as one of these spies.  This raven-haired beauty is not only handy with a dagger but a formidable sorceress as well.
^F02 
Provinces
Diemed's six provinces are strong enough to withstand the incursions of stronger neighbors, including the Spider.  
^F02 
Ciliene on the Arnienbae is the strongest province; it abuts Anuire City and controls all southern approaches to the Imperial Capital.  The baron could cut most of the trade routes to the city if he ever felt so inclined.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Darien Avan, prince of nearby Avanil, has influence in several of Diemed's provinces, but has not yet made any moves to turn them against their rightful ruler.  The Orthodox Imperial Temple of Haelyn maintains a strong presence in Diemed, as represented by the priest Lavalan Briesen (MA, Pr5, Haelyn; An, major, 30; LG).  He challenges the Temple from Avanil, claiming that Darien Avan directly controls it.
^F02 
One guild or another has contested every open guild holding in each of Diemed's provinces, and the baron plays every one of them off the others.  Better that, he reasons, than let guilds operate in every town.  Some whisper that the baron wants to lure Guilder Kalien of Endier into marriage with his daughter, the Lady Lasica -- but to what end, no one knows.
^F02 
Description
Though Diemed, like its neighboring kingdoms, is composed mostly of rolling grasslands, it remains uniquely beautiful.  Farmers maintain its fields in nearly perfect order across the realm, and its orchards and towns seem just as well kept.  The strong-willed citizens maintain a tight grip on their emotions.  Most keep to themselves, even in times of trial.  While not exceptionally loyal to the baron Heirl Diem, they revere the office he fills.  As long as he rules well, they stay content.
^F02 
The mountainous province of Bliene seems not so lawful, however, and in the mountains Diemed's true beauty shines through.  Anyone climbing the tallest peak can see storm clouds down below, stretching from Brosengae across the plains of Diemed.  One also might see the camps of brigands or stumble upon a solitary mage in these forbidding peaks.  On a clear day, the distant tip of Mieres becomes visible, so locals often watch for approaching raiders from these peaks.

^F02 
Regent: Rogr Aglondier (MA; W3; Ma, minor, 21; NG) 
He was an exceptional commoner once, a trusted adviser and apprentice to the blooded count before him, Moeran Aglondier.  However, he did not descend from the ancient bloodlines.  Rogr never felt so astonished as the morning he woke up to discover he had inherited the old man's bloodline, his royal name, and the Free County of Ilien.  Aglondier is the only known mage of the realm.
^F02 
The count rules Ilien wisely and well, doing his best not to make the mistakes of the regents around him.  Neither ambitious nor proud, he's willing to admit his faults.  His people enthusiastically support him, for he keeps their loyalty high and their taxes low.
^F02 
Aglondier claims Ilien is neutral, a statement that strays a bit from the truth.  He's good friends with the rulers from both Medoere and Roesone -- without their tolerance, his domain wouldn't exist.  Still, the nonpartisan illusion persists, so other rulers use the Free County of Ilien as a neutral meeting spot; regents have forged numerous treaties there.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Despite his many good qualities, Aglondier isn't really the trusting sort.  His only lieutenant is his daughter and heir, the Lady Alliene Aglondier (FA; Pr3, Nesirie; CG).  Together, the two can react to nearly any emergency that arises in the kingdom.  A blonde-haired beauty, Lady Alliene shares her father's good natured spirit.
^F02 
Provinces
Ilien is a single province with a rating of (7/0).  Its capital is the Free City of Ilien, located at the mouth of the Adele River.  A castle (7) rises in the center of town.  None of the several other towns that dot the province approach the size of the Free City.

The trade of Ilien falls under the management of Guilder el-Hadid (MKh; T3; Br, tainted, 10; LE), a Khinasi trader who makes his activities seem above suspicion.  Of course, appearing completely honest in itself indicates suspicious activities.
^F02 
Aglondier, the only known mage in Ilien, ties his magical holdings closely to the Erebannien; his sources dot Ilien, Roesone, Medoere, and Aerenwe.
^F02 
Description
Like the terrain of surrounding kingdoms, Ilien's rolling grasslands and small ranges of hills are extensively farmed.  Breeders across Anuire prize Ilien's cattle -- indeed, cattle money has earned the county its fortune.  This point has given rise to several common, derogatory remarks about the Ilienese, the kindest of which refers to them as dungslingers.  The ranchers of Ilien soothe their wounded pride with the money their commerce brings in.
^F02 
A small piece of the Erebannien crosses the southern part of the county, as lush and beautiful as in Aerenwe.  The small town of Aenier on the edge of the Straits of Aerele at the mouth of the Spider River caters to wealthy travelers, who wish to enjoy the Erebannien and the warm waters of the Straits.  Aenier is renowned across Anuire as a scenic place for the elite to gather and relax -- unless the fog has rolled in off the water.

Regent: Archpriest Suris Enlien (FA; Pr4, Ruornil; Re, major, 32; NG)
The Archpriest of Ruornil's Celestial Spell, Suris Enlien (FA; Pr4, Ruornil; Re, major, 32; NG) keeps a close watch over this land, controlling her theocracy with a velvet fist.  This beautiful priestess is tough and independent, seizing the three provinces that compose Medoere from Diemed and forging a new theocratic kingdom.  Unfortunately, her control is not as absolute as she would like, so she enforces her edicts a little more harshly than she should.
^F02 
As a priestess of the god of moon and magic, Enlien spends most of her days abed and works under the moon at night.  Therefore she takes care of most of her courtly work at night also, giving her capital city of Braeme a different schedule than the rest of the kingdom.
^F02 
Lieutenants
The high priestess has one lieutenant, the commander of Medoere's tiny army.  Lord Kotrin Skirvin (MR; F3; An, minor, 18; CG) has a little blood of his own, so the regent keeps a close eye on him, knowing that his ambition might strip away his common sense.  Other than that one flaw, she has chosen her commander well, and the two see eye to eye on policy matters.
^F02 
Skirvin is an ambitious, hardened Rjurik warrior who contols the armies of Medoere.  Loyal to the Archpriestess but also somewhat hot-headed, he is an excellent tactician and military strategist.
^F02 
Provinces
Almost a hundred years ago, Brun Szareh, an ambitious priest of Ruornil, carved three provinces from Diemed, still weak from the loss of land to Roesone.  However, Suris Enlien became the first ruler of a fully independent and free Medoere eight years ago.  Heirl Diem, Baron of Diemed, seeks ways to reunite these lost provinces with his own kingdom, and rumors claim he's waiting for any excuse to war with Medoere for his ancestral lands.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Guilder Kalien from Endier controls the law and guilds of Caerwil.  He and Enlien have yet to reach an understanding of who's in charge there, and the two have nearly come to physical disagreement.  For now, though, they remain content to settle their differences through subtle intrigues.  Yet Caerwil answers to the theocracy only when Guilder Kalien wills it.  The archpriest's attempts to wrest away control of the law have made the guildmaster determined to turn the province against her until she buckles -- or until she drives him and his cronies from the land.
^F02 
Archpriest Suris Enlien recently gained a Court Wizard.  Hermedhie (FA; W7; Vo, major, 24; LN) has yet to invest regency into the theocracy, but the regent and guilder both take steps when necessary to ensure that nobody else (namely, Aglondier) gains new sources in their provinces.  Though neither Enlien nor Kalien knows Hermedhie well, both of them have faith in her.
^F02 
Description
Medoere's terrain resembles that of neighboring Diemed: predominantly hills and meadows.  The fields look ordered and well kept, and the towns form in the same clear pattern, but there's a certain element of chaos to the air that doesn't exist in Diemed.  The people don't act as controlled as do those in Diemed, and they seem more likely to erupt in laughter and song than their western cousins.  Though the priests levy their taxes and control the laws, the people still enjoy a certain amount of freedom.  The theocracy doesn't crush their spirits, but encourages the best from everyone.
^F02 
The priests definitely hold the power here.  They act as guardians of the public spirit, both morally and physically.  Empowered to use force as necessary to preserve the common good, all priests prove well trained in the physical arts.  Fortunately, Suris Enlien also makes sure they undergo thorough testing, to weed out those who come to Ruornil's priesthood solely to gain power.  Of course, in Caerwil, the law remains open to interpretation; Guilder Kalien does his best to make sure the priests there give him as much loyalty as they give to their god.
^F02 
The weather in Medoere is a little strange, affected by both the trade winds from the Straits just to the south and the constant storm brewing over the Spiderfell to the north.  Occasionally storms will blow north from the sea to meet the cloud perpetually over the Spiderfell, and Medoere takes the brunt of the damage.  Though the climate makes the land look a bit gloomy, it has given the populace that much more resolve to enjoy life.

Regent:	The Spider
The Spider
The Spider, one of the original awnsheghlien, rules the wood called the Spiderfell.  Locals say the creature becomes aware of any intrusions into its forest, that it can see through the eyes of the spiders in the woods.  Popular folklore also has it that the Spider can put itself into the body of any lesser spider in the borders of the woods, though this last may stem merely from the nightmares of the regents who share a border with the fell.
^F02 
Every once in a while, the Spider sends forth its humanoid armies to wreak havoc on surrounding domains.  The attacks seem to lack a pattern entirely -- the Spider attacks who it wants, when it wants.  Thus, its neighbors usually leave at least a token garrison at the Spiderfell frontier.
^F02 
Lieutenants
If the Spider has any advisers or aides, they're unknown at this time.  Humanoids have been promised haven in the Spiderfell if they agree to work for the Spider, so gnolls and goblins serve the abomination willingly, scurrying through the dimly lit depths of the forest to carry out the Spider's bidding.  Sometimes even these minions run afoul of the wood's arachnid inhabitants.
^F02 
Description
The Spiderfell, located between the Heartlands and the Southern Coast, contains no individual provinces.  This monstrous domain is one of the darkest forests this side of Vosgaard, both physically and spiritually.  The locals rightly fear this area, where the very land and climate grow warped under the creature's dreadful might.
^F02 
A heavy, gray cloud hangs perpetually over the Spiderfell, causing occasional rain, but mostly confining itself to threatening rumbles.  Little light penetrates the canopy of leaves, leaving normal underbrush to wither and die.  Strains of shrubs that aren't entirely normal have taken their place, and their corpse-white leaves provide some phosphorescent illumination even in the darkest night.  The berries that grow on these bushes prove poisonous, so lethal that a single one can kill a man.
^F02 
As befits its name, this domain crawls with spiders.  They range from about the size of a child's fingernail to that of a small pony, and almost all of them are venomous.  The most dangerous of all are the head-sized albino spiders, who prey on humans.
^F02 
In addition to its denizens, anyone fool enough to travel in the Spiderfell would best beware the hazards inherent in the terrain itself.  Deadfalls await in the high places and quicksand in the low, and thorn trees can block even the game trails.
^F02 
Despite these dangers and the ever-present threat of the Spider, the Spiderfell is still an excellent source of timber.  In fact, its lumber is prized across Anuire by artisans and craftsmen.  Of those who brave the Spiderfell in search of the wood, not everyone makes it back.
^F02 
^F06Other Domains
^F02 
The previous domain descriptions covered the Southern Coast's kingdoms: domains with political boundaries one can find on a map.  However, characters don't have to rule kingdoms to control domains that have shaped the South; many blooded priests, rogues, and mages have vital holdings more appropriate to their classes.  Unfortunately, it's impossible to show all these domains on a map or to describe so many here.
^F02 
However, this section (and similar sections) does describe the domain of a single influential priest, thief, and wizard regent who does not rule an actual political kingdom.  Use these descriptions as examples to flesh out the listings of the other nonpolitical domains that follow for each class.  Every guilder, priest, and wizard mentioned earlier in this chapter appears in this section.

Description
The Impregnable Heart of Haelyn, though by far the strongest temple on the Southern Coast, can't compare to the powerful temples of the Heartlands.  Unlike many of Haelyn's temples, the Impregnable Heart has stayed fairly moderate, acknowledging the need for other faiths.  Countering this attitude is this temple's need to expand.

^F02 
Description
El-Hadid has a fleet of several ships that continuously make the run between Ilien and Ariya.  With the money he makes from his shipping interests, he has slowly branched into land interests.  He's making headway against his competitors, especially Siele Ghoried, who seems a little too naive for the business.  Orthien Tane and Guilder Kalien remain el-Hadid's most pressing opponents, as neither is above using a little judicious muscle to back up business interests.

^F06The Western Coast
^F02 
The Western Coast reaches from the waters of the great bay called the Tael Firth down to the Straits of Aerele and extends east to the Seamist Mountains.  It looks like a wilder place than most of Anuire.  The tops of pines rise high against the blue of the sky and the backdrop of the mountains.  Wooden stockade towns appear here and there on the tree-covered landscape, their strong walls keeping out the wolves, bears, ogres, trolls, and other creatures from the mountains that still call the land their own.
^F02 
Only the Northern Marches are more sparsely populated than this region.  Perhaps settlers have avoided it because of the fierce storms that lash the coastal provinces.  The Seamists protect the rest of Anuire from the worst of the storms, but the Western Coast has no such shield.  The challenges of the coastal climate have made those who live here a hardier breed.  Though still civilized, they possess a coarser edge than one might expect from Anuireans.
^F02 
Settlers have been arriving in record numbers of late, many of them tired of the political hustle and bustle of the eastern kingdoms.  Of course, they expect they can bring their cultured ways with them.  Their desire for the comforts of home within their wild new environment raises the hackles of long-time Western Coast residents.  Though tensions seem high now, it's only a matter of time before the newcomers adapt to the frontier life, or pack up and go home.
^F02 
More goes on in the politics of the Western Coast than anyone realizes.  Personal grudges and familial feuds dominate smaller kingdoms of the region, and policy is decided as much by personal loves and hatreds as by what's best for the domain.  One serious contender for the Iron Throne lives in the region, and the archduke Aeric Boeruine intends to keep it that way, working to keep his rivals down while building himself up.
^F02 
^F06Today on the Western Coast
^F02 
	Rumors circulate that a forester from the kingdom of Talinie found a tighmaevril weapon, then disappeared from public view.  Scions are converging on Talinie from all over Anuire; some arrive from as far away as the lands of Vosgaard! If indeed the stories hold truth, and a mere woodcutter wields the weapon, then it's a prize worth the taking indeed! Of course, some inevitable doomsayers call the tale a trap for those of the blood.  Yet, who could think to eliminate so many scions and regents all at once?
^F02 
	Spies and scouts report that Rhuobhe Manslayer, the Elf awnshegh, has begun preparing a major offensive against the human kingdoms nearby.  It seems his kingdom holds more elves than previously thought, and their martial readiness has frightened the regents of the area.  And if the scouts saw the elves, there's no doubt that the elves could see the scouts -- and that means Rhuobhe has plans more devious than simple land grabs.  The only problem lies in finding out what those plans are.
^F02 
	Explorers continue to discover ancient elven towers in the Aelvinnwode -- some of them with their wealth and treasures still inside.  They also contain traps enchanted with magic beyond the comprehension of some of the best mages and thieves in the area.  Friendly elves say that the towers' owners left them loaded with wealth as temptations for the greedy humans, a final act of defiance to the encroaching tribes.
^F02 
	Further, these elves claim that the items left in the towers are just baubles and junk -- yet elves have been seen attempting to breach the defenses of certain towers.  Surely they would not risk their lives for garbage -- or so the reasoning goes.
^F02 
Perhaps the elves' behavior merely adds another layer to their ancestors' subtle ploy to lure humans to their deaths, but the elves might be attempting to recover for themselves the lost wonders of the age before man.
^F02 
	Armies from the domain of Boeruine mass on the border of Taeghas to the south, signaling the start of another period of skirmishes between Boeruine and Avanil (Taeghas's eastern neighbor and liege).  It seems that once again the diplomatic process has broken down, and the kingdom of Taeghas will suffer for it.
^F02 
	The people of Taeghas feel truly sick of their role as pawns in the continual maneuverings between the two contenders for the Iron Throne.  Harald Khorien, Count of Taeghas, has let it be known that the domain seeks aid from someone who can keep the conflict between Boeruine and Avanil on a plane that does not involve armies.
^F02 
	Folks whisper that the trolls and giants of the Seamist Mountains grow ever more restless in their mountain holdings.  Raids and forays into human-held lands increase in frequency, but nearby regents seem too busy with political games to take much notice of a few monsters.  They have concerns more immediate than a few mountainside villages; until trolls destroy a larger city, the regents simply can't be bothered.  Scions unattached to realms might find the mountaineers suitably grateful for assistance in ending the troll raids, however.
^F02 
	Orog and goblin attacks from the Seamist Mountains have become much more frequent lately.  Folks murmur that the creatures have finally managed to break through the ancient dwarven defenses that had kept them locked underground.  Some say that Rhuobhe's elves had a role in the breakdown of the dwarven barricades, which means the abomination has insidious plans for the provinces of the Western Coast -- plans that just now are beginning to reach fruition.

Army
Boeruine boasts the third-largest army in Anuire; only those of Ghoere and Avanil surpass this Western force.  The archduke maintains a stance of war-readiness at all times, in the face of the threats presented by the Manslayer, the Five Peaks, and Avan's armies in Taeghas.  Boeruine's forces comprise:
	4 units of archers.
	4 units of infantry.
	3 units of elite infantry.
	3 units of knights.
	3 units of pikemen.
	3 units of scouts.
^F02 
Regent:	Aeric Boeruine (MA; F12; An, major, 60; LN)
The Archduke of Boeruine numbers among the most powerful of Anuire's current rulers.  He claims to be born of a derivation of Roele's bloodline, making him the heir to the Iron Throne.  As the other claimants to the throne dispute his genealogy, the archduke has little hope of taking the much coveted Iron Throne peacefully.  Boeruine, however, does not seem to care.  His strong bloodline boosts his surpassing faith in his destiny, and the archduke feels as content to carve an empire for himself with sword as with the diplomatic pen.  He uses kingly edict or knightly steel to topple those who would stand in his way, considering his rise to the Iron Throne paramount.  Good and law will arise from this ascension, he knows.  The regent won't wait much longer before making a bold move toward the Imperial City.  Already he seeks to claim the throne of Avanil.
^F02 
A firm believer in reciprocation, Boeruine always repays a favor done for him -- or a harm done to him -- no matter what the cost.  Few would willingly cross the archduke, and those that have done so regret it.  He treats his people in the same spirit of fairness, answering their needs with laws.  He taxes them moderately, but demands their absolute loyalty.

Boeruine's lieutenants are regents themselves: the mage Innes (MA; W7; Vo, minor, 19: LN) and Guildmaster Arien (MA; T3; Re, minor, 14; CN) each have their own domains but swear fealty to the archduke.  He doesn't care how they accomplish the tasks he sets for them -- just that they do so.  Though these lieutenants resent his heavy-handed rule, they realize that working for him is the best way to advance their own status.
^F02 
Important NPCs
The commander of Boeruine's army in the province of Redoubt is Lyien Charie.
The 8th-level, middle-aged general -- a man built like a barrel -- has served the Boeruines all his life.  No one ever questioned his devotion, but now he feels the pressure of his heritage: His elf grandfather, who serves Rhuobhe Manslayer, has asked him to lead a force of elf brigands into the very heart of the province.
^F02 
Description
Boeruine's nine provinces contain only three terrain types -- plains, hills, and forest.  The wind shears the coastal plains, but locals still raise herds of cattle and sheep here.  The folk pretend to sophistication, and fervidly support their monarch above all others in his bid for the Iron Throne.  One might think the people fear outsiders; certainly, they look unkindly on those who don't support their liege.
^F02 
Capital
The capital of Boeruine is Seasedge, and the castle Seaharrow has marked the port for hundreds of years.  Sailors come from across the continent to this busy harbor.
^F02 
Trade Goods
Roads criss-crossing the kingdom allow traders to carry wood, fish, and grain to the distant corners of the land.  Boeruine's trade routes run from Seaharrow to Anuire and Ilien, and roads connect the seaports to the other provinces.
^F02 
Allies
Talinie has declared Boeruine the rightful ruler of Avanil, but commits no troops or gold to the archduke's cause.  Alamie has allied itself cautiously with Boeruine, but only in the matter of containing the goblin tribes of the Five Peaks.  The ruler of Alamie remains too canny a politician to declare an alliance with Boeruine openly, and Tuornen's regent dares not, stuck as he is between the two powers.
^F02 
Enemies
The most vocal of Boeruine's foes is Darien Avan, Prince of Avanil.  The archduke hungers for Avan's blood and position, and the prince seeks to extirpate his most powerful enemy.  Allies of Avan (or those forced under his rule) likewise oppose Boeruine's claim to the Iron Throne.  They include Taeghas and (marginally) Brosengae of the Western Coast, as well as other kingdoms far enough away to offer Avan only coin and moral aid.
^F02 
Special Conditions
One reason the archduke has not already swept across Anuire is that Rhuobhe Manslayer's domain directly abuts the southeastern corner of Boeruine.  Defeating the awnshegh would make his route to conquest far clearer.  The attentions of the Elf remain always a factor in troop movements in this region.
^F02 
The archduke considers Rhuobhe a personal enemy, as Manslayer has tried several times to take his life -- and bloodline power.  But not only has the regent proved too wily for the Elf's assassins, he has nearly brought down the awnshegh himself.  Fortunately, Rhuobhe hates the other human kingdoms just as much as Boeruine, so he spreads out his attention.

^F02 
Regent:	Rhuobhe Manslayer
The land of Rhuobhe takes its name from Rhuobhe the Elf, called the Manslayer, and one of the original awnsheghlien.  One of the few elves who did not renounce Azrai at Deismaar, Rhuobhe absorbed a goodly part of the god's essence and now rules a tiny domain wedged between Tuornen, Taeghas, and Boeruine.  It is one of the last elf lands in the Aelvinnwode, and Rhuobhe always seeks to expand his territory.
^F02 
The Elf hates all humans, even more so now than when he joined forces with evil.  He goes out of his way to kill any human he can: man, woman, or child, but especially regents.  He sees himself as protector of the forests and guardian of a lost elven way of life and takes an active part in destroying the Anuireans around him.  He is willing to work with humans, but only to cause even greater harm to them eventually; he always betrays those who have allied themselves with him.
^F02 
A fierce opponent, Rhuobhe remains unflinching in his dedication to returning Cerilia to the elves.  He has lived for well over a thousand years now, and his outlook toward the "human encroachers" grows steadily worse with each passing year.  He broods in the Tower Ruannoch, a single blackened spire that rises high above the forest around it, and he formulates his plans of destruction.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Rhuobhe has no lieutenants as such, but trusts all his band equally.  Thus, each of them works to match the ferocity and hatred of their liege.  In essence, then, Rhuobhe has a small army of lieutenants to deal with problems that might arise, or to send out as agents of agitation or espionage.
^F02 
Provinces
Consider Rhuobhe (2/9) at once both kingdom and province.  It is as developed as any elf land -- that is, hardly developed at all.  It has no cities, temples, or guilds.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Only Rhuobhe has any stake in his own land.  Though some people certainly would love to influence Rhuobhe, none of those who try actually live long enough to do so.  Folks call the Elf "Manslayer" for good reason, and he does not negotiate with humans -- at least, not seriously.  He plays at diplomacy solely for his own amusement, but he has sent back far too many diplomats' heads for any regent to seriously consider ambassadorial missions to his realm.
^F02 
Description
As previously mentioned, Rhuobhe is situated between Boeruine and Tuornen, with borders also on Taeghas and Avanil.  The two immensely strong kingdoms on either side of the realm are all that keep the Manslayer from taking the Aelvinnwode back from the humans.  Likewise, the fact that Rhuobhe controls the major outlet through the mountains, Clearwater Pass, is the only thing that keeps Avanil and Boeruine from attacking each other outright.
^F02 
The truly beautiful land of Rhuobhe possesses an undercurrent of savagery, outlined in the very posture of the trees.  It's as undeveloped a country as a traveler might chance upon, though the elves carefully tend the trees to keep them green and healthy even through the freezing Western winters.
^F02 
The Tower Ruannoch sits on the shores of Clearwater Lake, which casts back a reflection of the tower in a more pristine state.  The lake is fed by pure mountain streams that pour down from the Seamist Mountains into Rhuobhe.
^F02 
A group of fewer than a thousand elves has stuck by Rhuobhe throughout his long years.  Those who are killed are replaced by their children, and some say that elves from Tuarhievel and the Sielwode come to learn the ways of hatred to take back to their people.  The elves of Rhuobhe, though civilized and proud, share the goal of Rhuobhe himself: to drive the humans from the land.  Their highest honor they reserve for one who kills a human of noble blood.  War parties occasionally steal out to raid human lands.  It's said that tunnels in the Seamist Mountains, leading all the way to Tuarhievel, hold still more of Rhuobhe's elves.  Some even whisper that the elves are in league with the orogs and goblins under the mountains.

As they have few scruples and compete directly with each other, they will stoop so low as to sabotage each other's holdings.  Soon the thane will put a stop to it.

Army
The army of Talinie is not large -- barely enough to contain the goblins and bandits of Thurazor and the Five Peaks, in fact.  If Boeruine or one of the Rjurik jarldoms decided to invade Talinie, the thane could do little to repel them.  Her army consists of:
	1 unit of archers.
	3 units of infantry.
	1 unit of scouts.
	1 unit of mercenary cavalry.
^F02 
Regent:	Thane Thuriene Donalls (FA; Pr6, Haelyn; An, major, 30; LG)
The Thane of Talinie controls the Northern Temple as its Supreme Hierarch.  She is a fanatic about her faith, as one might expect from the ruler of a theocracy.  Though she tolerates people of other faiths, she'd just as soon crush their temples.  She also can see the light of reason, though, and won't charge into a battle against another priest unnecessarily.  Still, she desires only to serve her god -- her people take a distant second to her relationship with Haelyn, and they know it.
^F02 
She watches over the domain of Talinie both spiritually and temporally.  Her guidance has kept it alive for more than 15 years now; without her and her predecessors, the kingdom would have fallen to Boeruine or, worse, to goblins and brigands.  Overall, she runs her kingdom well and has succeeded, against the odds in keeping it prosperous.
^F02 
The fairly excitable Donalls has found herself lured into several traps by enemies seeking her demise.  These near misses have granted her a bit more caution, but she hasn't entirely learned her lesson.  Her actions tend to be less than well considered, but she's learning.
^F02 
Lieutenants
One of her lieutenants, Torele Anviras (MA; W10; An, major, 35; NG), is rude, bad-tempered, and melancholy, but loyal to Talinie.  No one likes Torele but everyone regards him as an indespensable aid to the realm's defense.  This mage has source holdings in several parts of Anuire.
^F02 
One of her other lieutenants has been manipulating Thuriene Donalls without her knowledge.  Though unblooded, this 7th-level priest, Torias Griene, does have ambition.  The second most powerful hierarch of the Northern Imperial Temple, Griene sees that Donalls will give him no chance to ascend to the throne, but he can influence both church and state -- and reap the benefits of doing so.
^F02 
Important NPCs
The temple hierarchs rule the villages of Talinie, guarding the law and elevating the flock.  Such notables include Priestess Siobhan Riedhie (FA; Pr3, Haelyn; An, minor, 21; LG), the Watcher of Newcayne, in Greensward.  She commands the soldiers stationed in the border town, presides over the services in the temple, and passes judgment in the Hall of Law.  The literal-minded priestess feels devoted to Haelyn and his law, seeking always the higher truth.  Some posit that the thane is grooming her for eventual ascension to the throne of Talinie.
^F02 
Description
The forest of the Aelvinnwode covers the kingdom almost entirely.  Though most of its provinces have only sparse populations, this kingdom maintains sizable lumbering and mining industries.  These efforts do bring coin into the domain, but they have produced a significant negative impact on the land.  The woods slowly give way before the human expansion, and they don't grow back.  Since Donalls believes the land is here for humans to use, she does not let herself worry.
^F02 
For the most part, the people of Talinie share their monarch's opinion.  They have to make a living, and why should they move away from the lands they know best to do it? Some miners and foresters make efforts to heal the land's wounds, but they number too few to do any noticeable good.  It's hard to fight the prevailing sentiment that the land holds plenty of wealth, and that it can afford to give some up.
^F02 
The locals, a practical and religious populace, offer their stern devotion to Haelyn, as required by law.  Though they may seem somewhat crude, they are far from ignorant and resent any stranger who tells them otherwise.  These proud and independent folk rely on only themselves and their god.
^F02 
Capital
The capital of Talinie is the fortified city of Nowelton in the province of Ice Haven, from which Thuriene Donalls rules.
^F02 
Trade Goods
Hardwood lumber and coal are the dominant goods of Talinie.  Roads connect the mining provinces of Serimset and Freestead to Lindholme, and a sea route connects that province to Stormpoint in Taeghas.  Some trade also crosses the Black River into Boeruine.
^F02 
Allies
By casting its lot with Boeruine, Talinie has earned itself a powerful friend.  Thuriene Donalls's domain needs no other allies.
^F02 
Enemies
For its support of Boeruine, Talinie has earned the enmity of the kingdom of Avanil.  However, since Avanil's armies would have to march through three separate kingdoms to reach the northern coast, the thane puts the matter out of her mind.
^F02 
Of greater concern to the thane are her enemies just to the east and northeast.  Thurazor and the Five Peaks both see Talinie as a cheap source of raw materials and frequently cross the border to obtain needed lumber and ores.  Since the industries of Talinie have paltry defenses, the raiders take what they want with little trouble.
^F02 
Special Conditions
Though Talinie contains plenty of industry, it also boasts plenty of magical power.  Some say that the mage Torele Anviras (MA; W10; An, major, 35; NG) has discovered a way to summon forth magic even from cultivated lands.

^F02 
Regent:	Harald Khorien (MA; M4; An, major, 33; NG)
Harald Khorien, nominal Count of Taeghas (MA; W4; An, major, 33; NG), is a strong wizard, but not much of a ruler.  However, as Darien Avan has forced Khorien to swear fealty, the Prince of Avanil has his domain under his thumb.  Khorien does nothing without Avan's permission; he leaves the administration of his kingdom mostly to bureaucrats from the realm to the east, in exchange for control over that domain's magic.
^F02 
For the most part, this arrangement sits fine with Khorien.  He never wanted to be a king; the line passed to him without his knowledge or permission when his family died in one of Rhuobhe Manslayer's forays into human lands.  The succession disrupted his pursuit and studies of the magical arts he'd been researching and filled his time with the dull, everyday demands of running a kingdom.
^F02 
After word passed to the Prince of Avanil that Taeghas seemed less than pleased about the political demands on his time, Avan offered Khorien freedom from a king's duties in exchange for loyalty.  If the mage-king feels differently about the arrangement now, he shows no sign of it.  The count works as absentmindedly with Avan as he does with his flunkies, and displays no anger about the fact that he does not rule in his own kingdom.
^F02 
However, the count has shown willingness to defend his borders against those with whom he does not always agree.  His spells and armies tell anyone who might consider Taeghas an easy grab to reconsider.  Khorien has repelled more than one force from Brosengae or Boeruine, and seems tired of battles between Avanil and Boeruine tearing up his own domain.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Most of the count's administrative work is overseen by a group of skilled lieutenants left over from the rule of the previous count.  Of these, the leader is a respected military officer named Trevor Onwen (MA; F3; An, minor, 16; N), whose loyalties lie with Avanil.  He is plotting but capable.  He and the others control the apparatus of government, including the details of formal events, meetings with the ruler, and the disposition of royal funds.  They leave Khorien free to research his spells and learn more of the nature of magic.
^F02 
Provinces
Khorien oversees portions of land that Eriene Mierelen, Duchess of Brosengae would love to control -- namely, the provinces of Brosien, Islien, and Seasdeep -- but he's not willing to cede her these lands.  Though he has no interest in ruling, he also feels a personal distaste for Mierelen's desire to rule as much as he.  Consequently, he will not grant her a single inch of his vast territory.
^F02 
The province Bhaine holds the capital, Stormpoint, and the palace of the same name.
^F02 
Important NPCs
As in Brosengae Avan controls much of the law of Taeghas, and does so with an iron grip.  No rival mages live within the boundaries of Taeghas, though -- both Khorien and Avan see to that, as their best interests lie with the count controlling all the domain's magical resources.  This kingdom rich in magic hides away more than enough energy for the count in its forests and hills.
^F02 
The Archduke of Boeruine also nurses a secret interest in the law of Taeghas and has stymied many of Avan's edicts with revolts and whispering campaigns.  Trade in this kingdom is minimal, controlled by a guild under Khorien's thumb.
^F02 
Description
Taeghas encompasses a wide range of terrains, though all its provinces share the same temperate, seacoast climate.  In the north lies the southernmost region of the Aelvinnwode, while hills dot Aerele Bay on the Straits.  Rivers run everywhere, and moors cover the few places where the forest can't get a hold.
^F02 
The people, as a rule, seem independent and broad-minded, though they have a tendency to close up on certain subjects, such as Khorien.  Their ruler has not exactly inspired devotion and loyalty -- the citizenry knows that the regent financing their protection is not the one sitting on the throne in Stormpoint.
^F02 
Sandwiched between Boeruine and Avanil, Taeghas has become the major battlefield of those two powers.  Unless the count takes action, that situation seems unlikely to change.

^F02 
Regent:	Eriene Mierelen (F1/2E; Th7; Ba, major, 41; NE)
Eriene Mierelen (F1/2E; T7; Ba, major, 41; NE), Duchess of Brosengae, is also the force driving the Brosen Royal Guild.  She seeks expediency in all things, looking for the best way to turn a profit.  If a piece of her domain is not appearing profitable, either in the short-term or the long run, she will do her best to trim it from the kingdom.
^F02 
Mierelen has sworn fealty to the Prince of Avanil, but keeps secrets from her liege.  As she comes from a proud line of rulers and guild leaders, she has a keen eye both for politics and business and can quickly capitalize on any opportunities that come her way.  She is shrewd, expedient, and opportunisticm, and though she currently has sworn fidelity to Avan, she has opened secret negotiations with Boeruine -- to "be rid of Avanil's oppressive domination," as she so politely puts it.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Hyde Termonie (MA; Pr4; Br, minor, 21; CN), head of Sarimie's Temple of Fortune, is devout in his faith and slick in his negotiations.  This High Priest has many followers, but this dangerous man serves Mierelen out of convenience, not loyalty.
^F02 
Provinces
The royal court in Bindier, one of the most impressive along the Western Coast, rivals even that of Boeruine.  Many Anuirean realms keep a permanent embassy in the capital, also called Bindier, making it a hotbed of intrigue and diplomacy.  Of course, little discussion of much import occurs in Brosengae's negotiations, but the diplomats do their best to keep their lucrative postings to her court.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Avanil's significant law holdings in both Marilen and Coere allow him to control the majority of law in those two provinces.  Mierelen completely dominates the guild activity of her kingdom and tries to keep temple activity to a minimum.  Still, two temples have developed holdings here: Sarimie's Temple of Fortune and the Peaceful Seas of Nesirie find popularity among the people of this domain.
^F02 
Description
All the provinces in Brosengae are well settled throughout, though none of them can rival the province of Anuire in Avanil for sheer population.  The land not dominated by farms is covered in woods, and the woodcutters of Brosengae constantly ply their trade in the pine forest.
^F02 
Of all the Western realms, Brosengae feels most keenly the storms that plague the coastal region.  Since here the trade winds from Miere Rhuann meet those off the Arnienbae and the Straits of Aerele, scarcely a day goes by without a storm of some sort.  Whether a slight drizzle or a full-fledged hurricane, it's always raining in Brosengae.
^F02 
The two northern provinces fall prey to the trolls roaming down from the Seamist Mountains.  The duchess has to devote a garrison of troops to the provinces of Marilen and Coere to protect her people from the creatures' depredations.  She taxes the populace heavily, calling them "contributions to the cost of their own protection."
^F02 
The citizenry, especially in the north, seems surly at the best of times.  Folks labor under heavy taxes and see precious little return for their hard work except the fattening of their monarch's pockets.  Rebellion seethes just beneath the placid surface; fear of revolt causes Mierelen to worry more about her security, which makes the people even edgier.
^F02 
Occasionally, the duchess attempts to restore the people's loyalty to her by sponsoring celebrations or festivals, but unknown agents keep pointing out in public that these are blatant attempts on her part to buy the favor of the populace.  She suspects the source has ties to Avan, but she can prove nothing.  Besides, the populace has acted the same throughout her family's reign, so she feels helpless to do anything about it.  
^F02 
^F06Other Domains
^F02 
Many regents in the West wield substantial political power as rulers of actual kingdoms as well as through their control of sources, guilds, and temples.  For instance, the Northern Imperial Temple of Haelyn falls under the control of Talinie's ruler, while the Brosen Royal Guild reports directly to Brosengae's leader.  The most powerful mage of the Western Coast is also the nominal ruler of Taeghas.  All three of the example domains below have further details in the sections on their kingdoms.
^F02 
^F05Temples
^F02 
The fairly devout people of the Western Coast tend to choose a church and stick with it.  Though only Talinie has an official theocratic government, the temples of this region usually retain strong ties to the kingdoms where they originated.
^F02 
The Western Imperial Temple of Haelyn also plays a role in Western Coast politics.  However,  this temple concentrates its hold more fully in the Heartlands.
^F02 
The Northern Imperial Temple of Haelyn
^F02 
ALIGNMENT:	Lawful good.

Summary:	Centered in Talinie, the Northern Imperial Temple of Haelyn was one of the first faiths of Haelyn to splinter from the Imperial Temple of Haelyn.  It has survived by preaching fanatic devotion to the god, and its priests inspire this fanaticism in their congregations.

Most guilders of the West remain under the control of their domain's ruler: Arien Borthein (MA; T3; Re, minor, 14; CN) and Facellies Sloere (MA; T2; An, tainted, 6; CG), for example.  Still, a couple guilders try to milk the Western Coast for its riches without the explicit consent of the regents there.

Summary:	The Brosen Royal Guild has spread its reach north from Brosengae.  Its interests lie mainly in forestry and mining, though metalwork and carting have started to form a larger part of the picture.

^F06The Heartlands
^F02 
Patchwork patterns of farmland spread across the Heartlands, the sun playing gently on the fields of green and gold.  Shepherds keeping an eye on their flocks find themselves dozing in its warmth.  The people in the bustling southern Imperial Capital smile at the light glinting on the blue waters off their island city.
^F02 
Yet some areas of the Heartlands feel cold even in the summer's worst heat.  These brown, blasted tracts of earth mark the sites where countless armies clashed in historic battles.  Here nothing will grow -- the dusty earth has absorbed the blood of generations.
^F02 
The Heartlands have been the center of power in Anuire for longer than nearly anyone alive can remember.  Since the kingdom of Avanil in this region holds the Imperial City of Anuire, the realms have revolved around this land for nearly 2,000 years.  This region encompasses the territory east of the Seamist Mountains, south of the Stonecrowns, and north of the Spiderfell.  There's no natural eastern boundary, but everyone agrees that the Heartlands stop at the eastern border of Elinie.
^F02 
Most land in the Heart has long been claimed and cultivated.  A few ruins still await thorough exploration, and a handful of caverns have not been completely mapped.  Clearly, the main excitement in the Heartlands does not revolve around the breaking of untamed land.  Instead, this area features human drama, the subtle interplay of politics and armies, of espionage and trade.  Less sophisticated folk look to the frontiers for their thrills -- others seek their stimulation in the intrigues of the Heart.  
^F02 
The Heartlands have replaced the Southern Coast as the most civilized area of Anuire.  While the Southern lands have declined with the passing of the Empire, the Heartlands have flourished.  
^F02 
Of course, it's also true that the kingdoms of the Heart have been the subject of numerous coup attempts, takeovers, and invasions by larger neighbors.  There's rarely a dull moment in the Heartlands, and locals treasure those dull moments as respites from the constant action.
^F02 
As the center of old imperial politics, the City of Anuire offers plenty of intrigue to go around.  There's always a plot afoot to win the Iron Throne for some eager ruler, or a conspiracy to bend the ear of the current favorite.  So many schemes bubble in the capital that one can't even keep track of them all.  It's foolish to try, really; the plots change so quickly, there's no guessing what tomorrow or the day after will bring.  Any machination visitors might want to engage in likely will produce little result, but there's always the chance that a new plot will win the bold riches and power beyond even their wildest dreams.
^F02 
As always, Darien Avan, prince of the kingdom of Avanil, keeps his hand in the politics of Anuire.  This smooth and charismatic man can win enemies over with just a word or two.  And if he fails to win them that way, he can make them simply disappear.  Of course, these stories might just be rumors invented to discredit Avan -- and they might not be.
^F02 
^F06Today in the Heartlands
^F02 
	Other rumors claim Darien Avan is looking to solidify his hold on his province of Anuire -- and therefore, indirectly on the historically independent Imperial City of Anuire.  Reportedly, he'll even let his other holdings crumble to nothing, if he must.  The prince has been overheard more than once to say that the one who controls Anuire the city controls the Anuire the Empire.
^F02 
	Naturally, the other rulers of the Heart feel less than excited about the idea of Darien, Prince of  Avanil, demanding fealty from them.  Gavin Tael, Baron of Ghoere has, once again and to the alarm of his neighbors, begun "training" his armies on the border of his domain.
^F02 
The baron dismisses as hearsay and vicious slander reports that his imperialistic urges have gotten the best of him.  Of course, such statements from him don't reassure his neighbors at all, with his troops still sitting at their doorstep.  Some domains have begun massing armies at Ghoere's border to ensure that Tael means no harm.
^F02 
	There's rarely much danger of awnshegh attacks in the Heartlands, though the Spider has made some threatening noises again lately.  However, those who need to worry about it (namely, the kingdoms of Ghoere and Endier) have prepared well against possible Spider attacks.  What everyone expects but no one is truly ready for is the next rampage of the Gorgon.  Once per generation, this mightiest of the awnsheghlien marches through all Anuire, harvesting the new bloodlines and making itself ever more powerful.  Nearly 20 years has passed since last the Gorgon raged, and the land must ready itself for a riving.
^F02 
	The Guardians of Mhoried, that kingdom's army, have kept very busy lately.  Scouts have observed goblin and dwarf forces -- the combined armies of Markazor and Mur-Kilad -- training together in Markazor.  As the Gorgon commands these two domains, the Mhor is bracing his kingdom against the abomination's inevitable onslaught: Historically, the awnshegh marches through Mhoried first.  And, as always, goblin raids remain frequent along the Markazor-Mhoried border.

	 Law:	Darien Avan controls all the law of Avanil -- no one else has even a holding (0) in the realm.  The prince also holds most of the law of Taeghas in his grasp, as well as some in the Imperial City.
	Temples:	The Western Imperial Temple of Haelyn controls nearly all the religion of Avanil -- though the Celestial Jewel of Sarimie is establishing itself -- and Avan controls the priests of the Western Temple.
	Guilds:	Arron Vaumel, Governor of Mieres, has some say here, as does Eriene Mierelen, Duchess of Brosengae.  However, the sizable balance is held by Parnien Anuvier Iniere (MA; T2; Br, minor, 15; LN), who has fallen under Avan's control.
	Sources:	In exchange for the law in the kingdom of Taeghas, Avan allows Harald Khorien, Count of Taeghas, to control the magic of Avanil.  Though other wizards have gathered influence in Avanil, Khorien's power remains nearly absolute.

^F02 
Army
The army of Avanil, as mighty as the kingdom's treasury, can support 25 units at a time.  Much of the forces are spread through the domain and nearby allies, but a core unit or two remains near the prince.  The army includes:
	3 units of archers.
	3 units of cavalry.
	6 units of infantry.
	3 units of elite infantry.
	4 units of knights.
	4 units of pikemen.
^F02 
Regent:	Darien Avan (MA; F9; An, great, 70; LN)
This Prince of Avanil runs not only his own kingdom, but significant portions of other provinces as well.  Though he inherited much from his father, Veladan Avan, he has managed to amass an even greater portion of wealth and power than any had dreamed possible.  It did help that partial stewardship of the City of Anuire itself passed to him with the death of his father.  Nonetheless, Darien Avan capitalizes on any opportunity to expand his domain.
^F02 
The middle-aged prince seems well versed in the uses and abuses of power.  He strives for law and moderation in all things, but he, like the Archduke of Boeruine, appears willing to sacrifice his compatriots to gain the Iron Throne.  He believes that his knowledge of power will serve him well, and that he could be the best thing to happen to Anuire since Roele himself.  None dare to gainsay him.
See Darien Avan
^F02 
Lieutenants
Avan believes that a monarch can not carry his burdens alone.  Thus, he has entrusted his lieutenants with much of the governance of the realm, allowing him the freedom to work the strings of politics in his domain and others.  Dheraene Bhailie, a 7th-level thief and chief of the lieutenants, handles the prince's foreign affairs.  She plays the game of politics like few others in Anuire.  Of course, she has flaws like everyone else -- she's just more careful to hide them.
^F02 
Important NPCs
The best goldsmith in the city of Daulton, Laestier, is a half-elf who has foregone the use of his surname.  The big, bald man always proves a font of information and gossip.  He makes no claim to the truth of his talk, but he seems accurate far more often than not.  Though one of the most friendly, gentle people a traveler is likely to meet, he possesses an underlying sadness.  He also charges a pretty price for his work.
^F02 
Description
Like the rest of the Heartlands, Avanil's eastern provinces are covered by grasslands.  Grains grow here, and cattle roam -- but neither product matches the quality of that produced elsewhere in Anuire.  Avanil's grasslands give way to the hills and mountains of the western provinces, where miners constantly pull forth the earth's precious metals.  Sometimes at night, the lurid glow of smithies casts an infernal light across the clouds.  The common folk whisper that the Shadow World creeps closest on those nights.
^F02 
Capital
Since the Prince of Avanil never controls the City of Anuire, the ruling family long ago established the domain's capital city of Daulton in the province of the same name at the base of the Seamist Mountains.
^F02 
Trade Goods
The main wealth of Avanil arises from the mines in the hills and mountains.  Gold, silver, and iron are pulled from the mountains and exported around Anuire.  The smiths of Daulton work these metals into some of the finest jewelry and weaponry produced by human hands.
^F02 
Allies
Taeghas, just to the west of Avanil, has sworn fealty to Avanil.  With the Count of Taeghas's sanction, the prince's armies march up to the border to match their might against Boeruine's.  Brosengae, though under Avanil's rule, is not a strong ally.
^F02 
Enemies
Avanil's most powerful enemy is also his chief rival in his quest for the Iron Throne -- Boeruine.  The prince and the archduke Aeric Boeruine remain constantly at each other's throats, and no force in Anuire can stop their mutual hatred.  They watch the moves of other regents, each always looking for the hand of the other so he can counteract the plots of his counterpart.  Though they seem to act civilly in public, their words carry barbs apparent only to the other.
^F02 
Another enemy of Avan is the Imperial Chamberlain of Anuire, Caliedhe Dosiere.  The Chamberlain knows the prince and his politics, and Dosiere's work playing Avan and Boeruine off each other has continued to fuel their passionate hatred.  However, the Prince of Avanil doesn't realize Dosiere considers him and the archduke both unfit; he does what he can to win the Chamberlain's favor, knowing the man's word could make the next Emperor.
^F02 
Fortunately, enough other kingdoms border the Elf's domain to take Rhuobhe Manslayer's attention away from Avanil some of the time.  Yet the abomination does present danger enough that Avan keeps a permanent garrison in the north to ward against him.
^F02 
Special Conditions
The Avanese feel cautiously devoted to their liege.  They do not praise him with every word, but they take quick offense at deprecating remarks against him.  Though no law forbids speaking against the prince, someone doing so might want to leave the domain -- quickly, for even rogues here believe with pride that their lord is destined to become the next Emperor of Anuire.

	Law:	Gavin Tael, Baron of Ghoere, owns the majority of the domain's law.  However, the Mhor of the kingdom directly north also controls a small piece, which he uses to keep Ghoere in some disarray.
	Temples:	The Militant Order of Cuiraecen dominates temple holdings in Ghoere, which reflects the ruler's warlike ways.  Yet, the baron does pay service to a church called Haelyn's Aegis as well, and the upper class recently has become taken with the Life and Protection of Avanalae.
	Guilds:	Ghorien Hiriele (MA; T5; An, minor, 20; CE) controls most guild activity.  However, Moerele Lannaman of Mhoried and Guilder Kalien of Endier remain unwilling to let the baron's puppet guilder control all of Ghoere's lucrative holdings.
	Sources:	All Ghoere's magic is controlled by a being called the Sword Mage.  Clad in a robe apparently made entirely of blades, the Sword Mage remains a true mystery, as no one has ever determined the figure's identity.
^F02 
Regency Generated/Accumulated:	70/49 RP.
Treasury:	38 GB.
^F02 
Army
Though Ghoere's standing army numbers only 18 units, the mercenaries who serve him can summon their compatriots.  Thus, after two war moves, the baron's army can increase its size by another 10 mercenary units.  Ghoere's forces consist of:
	3 units of archers.
	3 units of cavalry.
	3 units of elite infantry.
	3 units of knights.
	3 units of pikemen.
	3 units of mercenary cavalry.
^F02 
Regent:	Gavin Tael (MA; F9; Re, major, 49, LE)
Gavin Tael (MA; F9; Re, major, 49, LE) is the indomitable Baron of Ghoere.  This ruthless man drives himself to extremes in his quest for power.  It remains a point of endless bitterness for him that all Anuire does not consider him one of the front-runners for the Iron Throne, but he has determined to gain it at whatever cost.  In a way, he feels pleased that Boeruine and Avanil have focused their attentions so on each other -- it makes his path to power that much easier.
^F02 
Tael, a man in his fifties, has iron-colored hair and a hard face.  He keeps his eyes shuttered against all surprise and emotion, so as to betray nothing of his true feelings.  This tactic makes him exceedingly difficult to read or understand, and there's no predicting what he'll do in a given situation.  No matter whether he feels furious or calm, angry or joyful, his face wears the same expression.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Gavin Tael has emulated some of his neighbors by recruiting other regents as lieutenants.  However, he does recognize that regents have their own priorities, and so unblooded men and women work for him too.  The most influential and capable of these is Jonathan Miechale, a man drawn from among Ghoere's populace to serve his baron.  Miechale's proud of this honor, and intends to do his job well.  Though he may not always agree with the decisions of his liege, he always feels determined to carry out his orders to his fullest ability.
^F02 
Important NPCs
It's said that the Sword Mage (?V; W10; Vo, major, 42, LE) hails from Vosgaard and draws additional power by summoning and controlling fiends.  Though there might be no truth to the rumor, it's enough to keep anyone from assaulting the Sword Mage's magical holdings.
^F02 
Description
Though the terrain resembles that of the Eastern Marches, Ghoere possesses a certain brooding feel that can make visitors nervous.  The sun shines just as brightly here as elsewhere in Anuire, the wind blows scents just as soothing, yet the prevailing feel in Ghoere is of a country oppressed.
^F02 
The kingdom's central Anuire location gives Ghoere easy access to other domains -- a particularly frightening detail when combined with an evil ruler who doesn't fear the wrath of his neighbors.  Yet it's precisely this central location that has trapped Ghoere -- nearby kingdoms keep it contained.  If Ghoere pursues one neighbor, the others will step in where the borders grow weak.  All Ghoere can do is keep his army maintained, in shape, and ready to roll across multiple borders at a moment's notice.
^F02 
The trade town Ghieste sits just outside the Shadowmere swamp in the province of Ghiere.  Located on the river Maesil, Ghieste has a prime position to take advantage of any trade that comes its way.  Though one might suspect Ghoere of taxing anything that comes down the Maesil, this is not the case.  The baron's interest lies more in keeping trade flowing than in collecting the few petty coins he could reap from the tax.  Better, he reasons, to foster profitable trade than force that trade to operate underground.
^F02 
The eastern town of Ghieste attracts both the best and the worst elements in the kingdom.  The scum come here to steal from merchants going home with fat purses, while good folk visit to hear news of the outside world and to broaden their horizons by meeting outsiders.  Such experiences cause some locals to leave Ghoere -- but most come back.
^F02 
Capital
Ghoere's capital is the fortified city of Bhalaene in the center of the domain.  The castle (6) Rook's Roost squats in the center of town like a promise of strength.
^F02 
Trade Goods
Ghoere produces steel, grain, and sheep.  Roads cross the kingdom, and the river Maesil carries an exceptional amount of goods and gold to and from the realm.
^F02 
Allies
For such a powerful kingdom, Ghoere has surprisingly few allies.  Of course, everyone recognizes Ghoere's blatant expansionist urges and refuses to deal with the kingdom on a friendly basis.  The baron has proven himself overtly untrustworthy and manipulative.
^F02 
Some say Ghoere has had dealings with the Gorgon for some time, but no one has proof.
^F02 
Enemies
For the same reason Gavin Tael has few friends, he has few enemies.  No one wants to cross him, knowing what his armies are capable of.  The closest thing to an enemy Ghoere has lies to the north: Mhoried bitterly opposes his neighbor's expansionism, and the two have come to the brink of war several times.  It won't be long before Tael tires of the Mhor's opposition and begins an all-out war.
^F02 
Special Conditions
The law in Ghoere is absolute.  The Iron Guards throughout the kingdom swiftly apprehend wrongdoers and relentlessly track fugitives.  They also make sure the only illegal activities are those the baron himself sanctions.

	Law:	The Mhor does not believe in holding law against his people.  He uses the regency from his law holdings and other ventures to repel those who would gain law here.  He has not been entirely successful -- Gavin Tael of Ghoere has gained some law holdings in Mhoried.
	Temples:	Here, three temples struggle for dominance: Haelyn's Aegis, the Militant Order of Cuiraecen, and the Oaken Grove of Aeric clash over the spirits of the Mhoriens.
	Guilds:	Moerele Lannaman (MA; T4; Br, major, 29; CG), the dominant guilder, also uses his profits to aid the kingdom.  The Mhor has small holdings in the guild, too.  Gaelin Thuried from Dhoesone holds power in the northern provinces, and Ghorien Hiriele from Ghoere works trade magic near the town of Riumache in the province Tenarien.
	Sources:	The Mhor's adviser, Regien (MA; W6; Vo, major, 30; CN), holds most of the magic of Mhoried, and he spends all his time protecting the land against possibly hostile sorcery.  However, he can be bought -- a weakness that the Mhor's enemies could exploit, if they only knew it.

^F02 
Army
The Mhor's army consists of hardy folk eager to serve their homeland.  All who serve in this regent's forces are volunteers; most end their service well trained, with a suit of armor and a good weapon.  In the light of the clear benefit of military service, all the levies the Mhor raises gain the status of irregulars.  
^F02 
Mhoried's troops call themselves Guardians, as they guard the Heartlands against invasion from the north.  It's said that once they even repelled the Gorgon himself! This force comprises:
	4 units of archers.
	3 units of cavalry.
	3 units of elite infantry.
	2 units of knights.
	3 units of pikemen.
^F02 
The bulk of the army stays in the northern provinces, warding against invasions from Markazor and the Gorgon.  The cavalry and two units each of archers and pikemen remain in the south to watch Ghoere's armies.
^F02 
Regent:	The Mhor, Daeric Mhoried (MA; R7; An, major, 46; CG)
The Mhor wards the kingdom of Mhoried.  Descended directly from Endira Mhoried, the woman who received this domain from the hand of the second Roele, the Mhor takes his responsibility to the land seriously.  Though some say another of his ancestors was the son of the Emperor, even the regent himself discounts this story.  Apparently, the crusty old woodsman has no interest in the Iron Throne.
^F02 
This conscientious ruler tries to ensure that his laws do not interfere with his people living free and happy.  He taxes them only to maintain the kingdom and levies only the laws that the people themselves demand -- most demand none.  His policy of lenience allows the Mhor to concentrate on military strategy to safeguard the lives of his people; his years of planning have made him a military genius.
^F02 
However, despite knowing he could lead his armies to the City of Anuire itself, Mhoried remains content in his home kingdom.  His ambition died years ago, and now he seeks only to protect the people he has learned to love in his years as regent.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Michael Mhoried (MA; F4; An, major, 46; LG), son and heir of the Mhor, studies the ways of rulership at his father's hand.  But before the heir can learn what it truly means to be a ruler, he must master the responsibilities of a lieutenant, handling problems neatly for his father.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Shaene Mhoried (MA; T5; An, major, 33; NE), the Mhor's talkative half-brother, wanted to start a small guild in Coeranys, but has had little luck.  So, this charming but crooked man spends much of his time in Mhoried, hoping to make it in politics.
^F02 
Description
Mhoried's highlands are home to some of the toughest people in Anuire.  Some have shady pasts, some live blameless lives.  All feel grateful to the Mhor for the chance to live in relative freedom.  The territory remains sparsely populated, for the locals don't much care for the constant presence of others.
^F02 
Capital
The capital of Mhoried is the fortress Bevaldruor, or "Shieldhaven." It lies in the province Bevaldruor, surrounded by the largest forest in the Heartlands.  Its central location in the kingdom means the Guardians can reach a problem anywhere in the domain with all possible haste.  Shieldhaven's strategic importance requires invaders to take it in order to hold the province -- and first they have to reach it.  The Guardians know this forest like their own homes, and they've dispatched many enemies in the woods.
^F02 
Trade Goods
Surrounded by rivers, Mhoried naturally has learned to depend on them for both sustenance and export.  Freshwater fish, game from trappers and hunters, crops raised by freesteaders, and wool and mutton from shepherds are Mhoried's chief exports.
^F02 
Allies
The tiny northern domain of Cariele has gone out of its way to stay on the best of terms with Mhoried.  Since Mhoried remains the only defender of the trade routes and roads leading into his County of Cariele, Entier Gladanil gladly pays the Mhor a small tribute.
^F02 
Enemies
Mhoried and Ghoere remain, at the best of times, uneasy neighbors.  At the worst, the Mhor works to restrain Gavin Tael's land-hungry tendencies without angering him enough to invade.
Other enemies include the kingdoms of the Five Peaks and Markazor; both flank Mhoried, and both repeatedly harbor armies that later march into Mhoried.  Though they have learned to regret their rash actions, these domains always venture south again a few years down the road.
^F02 
Special Conditions
One needs to know only a few laws in Mhoried.  Most of them seem like common sense, boiling down to one essential rule: Do anything you please, as long as it doesn't hurt someone else.  Also, the Mhor has made it illegal to harbor or consort with humanoids unless they've proven to have renounced the ways of evil.

	Law:	Laela Flaertes, Duchess of Tuornen, owns about one-third of the kingdom's law.  The rest is split between the Archduke of Boeruine and the Prince of Avanil or goes unclaimed.
	Temples:	The Western Imperial Temple of Haelyn and the Militant Order of Cuiraecen have split the temples of Tuornen, with the agreement that neither will seek to wrest away the other's holdings.  Of course, neither side has any intention of keeping this oath.
	Guilds:	Mheallie Bireon of Cariele and Parnien Anuvier Iniere of Avanil seek to dethrone the Duchess of Tuornen from her holding in Haesrien.  However, they first plan to wrest away the more threatening holdings of Eriene Mierelen, Duchess of Brosengae.
	Sources:	Caine from Endier has claimed nearly all the magic of Tuornen.  In return, the duchess asks only the occasional defense of her realm -- perhaps from the Elf, who holds the rest of the sources.  
		She doesn't expect much from Caine, and she probably won't get it.
^F02 
Regency Generated/Accumulated:	38/21 RP.
Treasury:	8 GB.
^F02 
Army
The duchess keeps a minuscule army, to show as little disrespect to her neighbors as possible.  She holds units only against Rhuobhe and the Five Peaks.  The army of Tuornen is:
	2 units of archers.
	3 units of pikemen.
	2 units of knights.
^F02 
Regent:	Duchess Laela Flaertes (F1/2E; B4; Br, minor, 35; NG)
She rules as Duchess of Tuornen.  She inherited the kingdom from a senile father, and she strives to rebuild it to its former glory -- or at least keep it from the hands of those who so avidly seek the Iron Throne.
^F02 
With three provinces bordering Boeruine and three on Avanil, Flaertes can not afford to make a mistake in her political dealings.  She walks a dangerous and narrow path between Avanil and Boeruine, striving to build her kingdom between the two super powers.  Her situation has given her a life of extreme tension.  Where other regents might give in to one or the other, she works to ensure that she takes no missteps that might cause her people to suffer.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Elf commander Braedonnal Tuare (ME; F7, Ba, major, 34; CG) holds the defense of north Tuornen.Though this firebrand would love to fight the awnshegh Rhuobhe, the duchess has forbidden it, reminding him that such an offensive would place the kingdom in considerable peril.  Influential but hot-headed, he has earned the nicknames "Hotspur" and "Firebrand".
^F02 
Important NPCs
An Alamien agent has set up shop in the court of Tuornen.  Baubb the Court Toymaker creates playthings for the children of Tuornen's nobles.  However, he's developed a spring-loaded poison needle that can shoot out from dolls and toy swords to kill children, which would surely leave the court of Tuornen in an uproar.  That's when the Alamien armies march in.  If luck sides with the Duke of Alamie, the nobles will feel too grieved to respond to the invasion well, and Tuornen will once again become part of Alamie.
^F02 
Description
Once a part of the Duchy of Alamie, Tuornen split off during a civil war between two brothers, both claiming to be the rightful heir to the Alamien regency, and both unwilling to step aside.  This schism brought war to Alamie, causing one of the mightiest of the old Twelve Duchies to fall.
^F02 
The kingdom of Tuornen has healed from the wounds of this war, fought 100 years ago.  Still, as in the Heartlands, places in the countryside remain where no living thing will grow again.  The prairie in the south slowly gives way to the hills of the western provinces, which in turn become mountains, forest, or a little of both.  But those who would travel here, through Elevesnemiere or Pechalinn, should take care, for Rhuobhe's domain lies nearby -- and human-hating elves sometimes creep from Rhuobhe into Tuornen to slay "despoilers of the land."
^F02 
The inhabitants of Tuornen seem generally friendly, but speak and act rather guardedly.  They derive from the same stock as the Alamiens, but the rift of the last century has caused the two peoples to drift apart culturally as much as politically.  The Tuors get somewhat defensive when confronted with the topic of the rebellion, but they also feel proud of their forefathers' defiance.  This pride drives them to prove themselves better than the Alamiens and excel in whatever they do.  Though they may fall short of the mark sometimes, no one can ever say they haven't tried.  Some neighbors think this drive makes the Tuors too proud.
^F02 
Capital
The capital of Tuornen sits just across the Tuor River from Alamie's capital -- Haes and Lofton were once one city.  However, after the civil war that rent the land, the city split in two.  Tuornen's Haes now dominates the river traffic, keeping the bulk of the bounty away from Lofton.  The walled city has kept out several Alamien invasions, and bears permanent scars as proof.  The Haesians in particular, and Tuors in general, look at these scars and remember the necessity of freedom from Alamien rule.
^F02 
Trade Goods
The Tuor River flows past the door of Haes, merging into the river Maesil just north of Endier.  The river, Tuornen's main trade route, makes the city of Haes a veritable seaport.  From the northern hills and mountains and the western forest come a plethora of goods -- lumber, furniture, gold, silver, and coal -- that other parts of Anuire desperately need.  Though no Imperial Capital, Haes remains one of the Heartland's main cities, bringing traders and visitors from all over to buy, trade, and see the sights.
^F02 
Allies
Tuornen has gone to great lengths to avoid choosing allies that would anger another nearby province.  Her efforts to remain neutral have earned the praise of the Mhor and the Patriarch of Elinie, but one could not honestly say that Tuornen has any true allies.  Even Avanil and Boeruine have not declared their allegiance one way or another -- which can only come as a relief to the beleaguered duchess.
^F02 
Enemies
Likewise, Tuornen has no true enemies -- with the notable exception of the Duke of Alamie.  Through policy, duchess has ensured that no other neighbors bear Tuornen ill will.  However, Alamie's enmity hasn't faded through Tuornen's century of independence.  Flaertes knows the Duke of Alamie constantly hatches schemes to retake what he sees as "his" lands, but so far she has managed to foil them.  However, she fears she'll fail one day.
^F02 
Special Conditions
Anyone visiting Tuornen should come prepared to deal with Tuor pride.

Regent:	Duke Carilon Alam (MA; F2; Ba, major, 46; NE)
Duke Carilon Alam
The descendant of the original Duke of Alamie rules here.  This greedy, avaricious man cares nothing for his realm -- he hopes instead to retake the Empire or at least make the histories reflect him as a great statesman.  He has little chance to accomplish either.
^F02 
The duke's first plan involves reclaiming Tuornen.  Though it seems improbable, he could succeed.  Alam wants to convince Darien Avan it would be in both their best interests to see Tuornen once again under Alamien rule.  He's promised the prince that the new Alamie's borders would be a perfect launching place for his armies.
^F02 
The Prince of Avanil isn't convinced.  He doesn't want to see Alamie grow, especially not at the expense of losing Tuornen as a possible ally.  Also, he doesn't trust Carilon Alam -- he knows the duke's plans seldom bode well for anyone but the duke.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Alam's lieutenants include his two cousins and his daughter, Dierdren Alam (FA; M6; Ba, major, 46; N).  He uses them like pawns on a chessboard and will sacrifice them if he must.  She serves him out of fear, not admiration, so they do not work as effectively as they might.  A mage of no mean skill, this dark-haired beauty is reserved but approachable.
^F02 
Provinces
Within the nine provinces of Alamie lies one fortress: Sorentier, in Sorelies.  It supports a pair of knight units secretly training to burst into Tuornen, as soon as the word comes in from Lofton, the capital.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Guilder Kalien of Endier owns much of the trade in Alamie.  The guilder has made it clear that the southern provinces answer to him; when the law steps in to remove any of Kalien's operations, people wind up dead.  On the other hand, the duke has let Kalien know that Alamie won't support any guild that doesn't pay tribute to the crown.  Burned warehouses and raids on illegal operations have cut into Kalien's interests.
^F02 
Description
Alamie has been unkindly described as one big flat stretch of grass.  Though this picture isn't entirely accurate, it does leap to mind when a traveler reaches the plains.  Until he gained the northern mountains, he'd have to call the terrain mostly featureless.  Waves of corn fill province after province, and the air smells of fertilizer.
^F02 
Alamiens share their regent's dislike for the Tuors.  They resent that the provinces to the west could be theirs to farm and hold, and they take this anger out on the Tuors they find.  The people of Lofton see themselves as more rational than their country counterparts, but they still harbor a lingering dislike for Tuornen.  Alamiens can be affable and friendly, though, as long no one broaches the subject of their enemies to the west.
^F02 
Alamie holds one of the most untenable positions in Anuire.  Stuck with a large border on Ghoere and another on Mhoried, the realm must tread a delicate line to avoid offending one of these two powers.  It's usually safer to anger Mhoried, but one can push even the Mhor only so far.  Alamiens also must worry about the threat of brigandage from the Five Peaks.  Finally, they know that Avanil lies merely a province away, should the prince choose to march through Tuornen or Endier.  Therefore, Alamie wants to regain the territory Tuornen now holds, to place more land between Avanil and Lofton.

Regent
The Imperial City technically has no regent -- only the Emperor of Anuire may claim it, but no one sits the Iron Throne at this time.  The closest functionary to a ruler the city has is the Chamberlain, Caliedhe Dosiere (MA; F12/W16; An, great, 64; LG), who carries the Emperor's signet ring bearing the Imperial Seal and ensures that no one takes the throne.
^F02 
Lieutenants
The Chamberlain asks trusted friends to undertake local missions necessary for the safety of the city.
^F02 
Provinces
The City of Anuire remains its own self-contained province, separate from Avanil.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Darien Avan, Aeric Boeruine, Caliedhe Dosiere, and Heirl Diem all control law in Anuire.  The Chamberlain holds by far the largest piece and works to prevent the others from attaining much power in the city.  The 10 major guilds of the old Anuirean Empire each own a bit of the city's trade (though only three gain regency from their holdings), and underground wars between them remain common.  The Western Imperial Temple of Haelyn dominates the city's religious life, but one can see temples of Anuire's major gods throughout the Imperial Capital.
^F02 
The Royal College of Sorcery's Ruling Council controls the magic of the city.  Ley lines used to flow from all over the continent into the City of Anuire, but most have fallen into disrepair.  The 10 wizards on the council control a single ley line each and allow blooded students to learn from these lines.
^F02 
Description
As a separate entity, the City of Anuire is governed by laws that do not apply to the rest of Avanil.  Situated at the mouth of the river Maesil, the capital remains home to the universities, museums, and bureaucracies that made the Imperial City the center of trade, learning, and diplomacy at the height of the Anuirean Empire.  Visitors still come from as far away as Vosgaard to study at the universities and learn intrigue at the Imperial Court.  Though an Emperor no longer sits on the Iron Throne, courtiers still gather here to ply their treachery and bargain for the fate of realms.
^F02 
Much of the City of Anuire is locked onto dozens of small islands, each of which comprises a different neighborhood.  The islands stay connected by means of bridges or ferries, depending on the tide.  At low tide, the ferries can not carry passengers from one island to another; the high tide washes the bridges underwater.  Brisk sea breezes can turn to gales brought on by storms brewing to the south.  A cunning series of sea walls protects the city from the worst damage from storms that drive inhabitants indoors for days on end.
^F02 
The city remains home to the Royal College of Sorcery, the largest group of wizards in all Anuire.  Counter to what some imagine, the Royal College is no vast tower its surroundings.  Its power dwindled with the fall of the Empire, and it now occupies a former barracks on the grounds of the old college.  The original tower lies in rubble on the coastline, destroyed by the internal feuds that broke out when the last Roele passed.  The mages chose the location of the new college to remind students of the price of pride.  The view of the still-smoking old tower demonstrates the folly of the old wizards.
^F02 
Despite the sinister smoke, some fools still explore the ruins, seeking the lost magical secrets of the ancients to increase their own power.  Some explorers actually have returned with treasures, which only encourages others.  Folks say that 10 levels lie beneath the smoldering ruins.  Though it might hold many riches, treasure seekers should pay attention to the stories of looters who simply vaporize somewhere in the ruins.

Regent:	Assan ibn Daouta (MKh; P10; Ba, major, 47; LG)
A family of Khinasi paladins, headed by the patriarch Assan ibn Daouta (MKh; P10; Ba, major, 47; LG), rules Elinie.  His ancestor came to Anuire in the company of Khinasi raiders (assassins, really) some 700 years ago.  Their mission was to investigate how to break Anuire's hold on their homeland.  Though they only made it as far as Elinie, they saw enough to make them realize it would be no simple matter to dissolve the Empire.
^F02 
While resupplying in Elinie for the trip back to Khinasi, they learned that the corrupt ruler of the kingdom was destroying the land.  Daouta ibn Hammoud, a scion of Khinasi, slew the regent, assumed the mantle of rulership of Elinie, and set about building a family and a dynasty.
^F02 
Now, after 700 years of ruling Elinie, the Daouta family has given up most Khinasi traditions, but their dark brown skin marks their ethnic derivation.  Depending on where they travel, their background accords them great respect or great hatred.
^F02 
The patriarch, an old man of strict nature, does not believe in meddling in the affairs of other kingdoms -- and not much in his own.  Though his calling as ruler demands he provide law for his people, he prefers they find their paths on their own.  He does not often legislate their concerns, but instead offers his wise suggestions in the Khinasi fashion.  When folks take his suggestions to heart, they prosper.  When they don't, the result is unforeseeable.  His justice to wrongdoers can be terrible.
^F02 
Lieutenants
The patriarch has three sons and three daughters, all paladins, striving to carry out the goddess Avani's will.  Though they compete to become heir, they feel no animosity toward each other.  The third daughter of the Patriarch, Kalilah bint Daouta (FKh; Pr7; Ba, major, 37; LN), seeks to show her father that she is fit to rule.  She has just recently returned from a sweeping quest to bring the evil Wizard to justice.  She is tough-spirited and exceedingly beautiful.

Elinie has seven provinces, none of them particularly well populated.  Ansien holds the capital of the same name.

The Life and Protection of Avanalae seems strong here.  Though the hierophant of this domain is not Khinasi, she adheres strictly to Khinasi beliefs and urges her followers to do the same.  They do call their goddess Avanalae, but only because the Anuirean name appeals to them more than the Khinasi name, Avani.  The hierophant appears malleable to the wishes of the Khinasi rulers.
^F02 
Guildmaster Elamien Lamier (FA; T2; Br, minor, 25; LN) headquarters her Points East Trading Guild in Elinie, her homeland.

Description
The people of Elinie resemble inhabitants of the Eastern Marches more than those of the Heartlands in temperament.  Though it borders on three hostile domains -- or perhaps because it does -- Eliniens have an indomitable spirit.  They stand resolute in their devotion to their regent, though they might not approve that he chose to worship Avanalae when most Anuireans follow Haelyn.  Still, his ancestors brought prosperity to a kingdom slowly degenerating, and every successive generation has made Elinie stronger.  The people thank him with their unwavering loyalty.
^F02 
However, many in Anuire find the thought of living under one of the Khinasi a fearsome prospect.  Though the Daouta family has ruled this kingdom for hundreds of years, those who live outside Elinie fear the Khinasi influence has corrupted its citizens.  This prejudice has caused Elinie's population to remain fairly constant, while nearby domains continue to grow.
^F02 
Nonetheless, Elinie prospers.  Cattle and horses aplenty roam here, taking their sustenance from the grasslands bordering on Coeranys and Mhoried.  Some of the hills rising and falling throughout the country conceal ancient elven fortresses whose secrets have not yet been unlocked.  The swamp Hope's Demise squats on the kingdom's eastern border, hiding hydras and other monsters no one can guess at, as well as the occasional criminal fleeing the kingdom of Coeranys or the patriarch's gentle but firm laws.  To the north lies the Sielwode, and woe betide the fool who wanders in sight of its unpredictable elves.  Elinie remains unique and beloved of its people.

^F02 
Regent:	Guilder Kalien (M1/2E; T5; Br, major, 30; NE)
This man, who took the reins of power from the unfortunate Endier clan, is the undisputed ruler of Endier.  He is ruthless, efficient, and very good at his trade.  This half-elf raised in Brechtur controls the law and the guilds, and through those two forces he commands the obedience of the temples.  Though not a gentle ruler, Kalien is canny enough to know that an unhappy populace means an unhappy regent.  Therefore, he buys people's loyalty with festivities and holidays.
Though evil, Kalien hides his taint under a mask of civility and diplomacy.  His court is renowned for its splendid celebrations, its glittering balls, and its fabulous feasts.  Kalien always has time at these affairs for diplomacy, as that's what pulls in the money -- what's a small investment for so huge a return?
^F02 
The guilder works hard to put others in his debt and constantly hatches new schemes to wring the most benefits from any situation.  He likes playing two sides against each other, preferably in such a way that neither can spot his influence.  He's always in the market for information, also, and his spies cover the land to bring him the most up-to-date details they can find.
See Guilder Kalien
^F02 
Lieutenants
Endier proves small enough that Kalien has no need to farm out problems to lieutenants.  (More to the point, he doesn't trust most people well enough to leave matters in their hands.) And, having risen to his current exalted position through betrayal and corruption, he's not willing to put power into hands that might abuse it.
^F02 
However, Wizard Caine (MA; W10; Vo, major, 27; NG), is an ageless wizard who lives in his tower Falcons' Roost, near the Spiderfell.  He draws his power from the river Maesil and the  Spiderfell.  In exchange for his small holding, Caine protects the land.
^F02 
Provinces
Endier has only a single province.
^F02 
Important NPCs
A mage named Caine (MA; W10; Vo, major, 27; NG) resides in Endier, though he draws his power from the river Maesil and the Spiderfell.  In return for spells and protection, Kalien ensures that no one tries to raid the wizard's tower -- at least no one under his command.  This agreement makes for a fairly lucrative life for them both.
^F02 
Endier splits its temple holdings between the priests of Haelyn and Sarimie.  The struggle for temporal power has been going on for some time, with no faction emerging victorious.
^F02 
Description
Endier is in a bit of a bind, wedged as it is between Avanil, Ghoere, Tuornen, Diemed, Alamie, and the Spiderfell.  It can not compete with the farms of the larger kingdoms, can not raise an army to rival theirs, and can not hope to defeat these powerful entities in any endeavor, except one -- trade.  Guilder Kalien has done his best to ensure that the words Endier and trade become synonymous.
^F02 
Initially, Endier was part of the Spiderfell.  Technically, Roele had awarded the land to Diemend, but House Diem never braved the Spider to claim it.  As in the case of the domain of Medoere, an enterprising scion named Richard Endier tore away a province while Diemed languished under an unfit ruler a few hundred years ago.  The country has managed to keep itself free of the Diem yoke ever since.
^F02 
Unfortunately, Richard Endier's heirs did not manage their kingdom very well, and it began to slide toward ruin.  Only the intervention of one of their lieutenants -- Guilder Kalien -- kept the domain from disaster.  Then, mysteriously, the heirs died off, one by one, in accidents beyond anyone's control.  Guilder Kalien sorrowfully took the reins of rulership and began leading Endier toward more prosperous times.
^F02 
Roads run throughout the province, making trade and travel quite easy.  The walled city of Endier sits at the junction of the Maesil and Tuor rivers, its many spires and Caer Endier castle rising above the other buildings.  It's a very civilized little country, and Kalien ensures it remains indispensable to its neighbors.  That way, Endier should never be invaded.
^F02 
^F06Other Domains
^F02 
The struggle for power in the Heartlands continues more in the hearts and minds of the people than on the battlefield, and more can be accomplished by signing a declaration than armies could hope to achieve.  For the most part, priest, wizard, and thief regents govern their domains with practicality rather than with ideals and virtues.  This outlook leads to many temporary alliances: Former foes will band together to bring down a giant.  Only excellent politicians get ahead in the Heart.
^F02 
^F05Temples
^F02 
The temples of the Heartlands exemplify the attitude mentioned above.  The priests here seem to care less about their faith and more about attracting worshipers, hoping to destroy their enemies through the loss of congregations rather than holy wars.

^F06The Northern Marches
^F02 
The vast Northern Marches hold much unspoiled land.  Some of this territory is the wildest in all Anuire.  It's a rough life on the frontier, but this existence has made the residents tougher than almost anywhere else in the region.  On the other hand, folks here also act less civilized than most, as they look more toward survival than toward mere creature comforts.  Living in constant fear of invasion or destruction, they have adopted a code that preaches living for today, rather than for the future -- what's the use of long-term investments when there might not be a tomorrow?
^F02 
An immense elven wood stretches hundreds of miles across the Northern Marches, its placid coolness capable of making one forget the wars of kingship raging elsewhere in the land.  This forest, the Aelvinnwode, blankets most of the region.  Though its green depths include many varieties of trees, hardy evergreens are dominant this far north.
^F02 
In stark contrast to the beauty of the Aelvinnwode, the malevolent glow of active volcanoes in the northeast illuminates an immense palace of jagged obsidian and iron towers.  This castle, the lair of the Gorgon, seems to scratch against the sky, defying the mountains from which it was hewn.  All around lie untamed realms, home to the humanoids that serve this abomination of pure evil.
^F02 
The Northern Marches include only two Anuirean kingdoms: Dhoesone and Cariele.  The region's other six domains are controlled by demihumans, humanoids, and a particularly unpleasant awnshegh.  The Stonecrown Mountains run throughout the North, hiding dangers for the unwary.  Whether these threats come in the form of bandits, goblins, or angry giants that destroy traders' caravans, no one can say.  But locals do warn visitors to stay on guard through the ravines of the Stonecrowns.
^F02 
The goblin kingdom of Thurazor to the far west has its own hierarchs, who are alternately friendly and hostile to their Anuirean neighbors.  Unfortunately, goblins are not exactly subtle, and most humans can see through their subterfuge.  Brigands, goblins, and (some say) ferocious orogs inhabit the "realm" called the Five Peaks.  The area is less a kingdom than a land ruled by a collection of robber barons.  The goblin kingdom, Thurazor -- not exactly an expert in the field of diplomacy -- bases its main foreign policy on exports and trade goods.  Though these materials seem of poorer quality than most Anuirean items, they cost far less.  This cost factor has allowed Thurazor to retain political and guild positions.  When goods arrive at market that appear far more skillfully made than the usual goblin fare, nearly everyone is diplomatic enough not to suggest that these items came from goblin raiders rather than from goblin crafters.
^F02 
The giants from the nearby Giantdowns occasionally cross the border south into Anuirean territory, pillaging any homesteads unfortunate enough to block their way.  Though the giants seem smart enough not to venture into the Gorgon's Crown, Dhoesone, Tuarhievel, and the Rjurik lands come under the giants' tread once every year or so.  No one has discovered a way to discourage the giants from their annual rampage.
^F02 
The main danger of the Northern Marches remains, of course, the Gorgon.  The awnshegh has made his stronghold here for 2,000 years, and people of the nearby realms long ago learned to avoid the foothills and mountains of the Gorgon's domain in the northeast.
^F02 
Still, their caution does them no good when the Gorgon emerges from his mountain fastness to harvest new bloodlines.  Over time, the population of the neighboring kingdoms has dwindled, as residents seek safer pastures.  The Gorgon has gone almost 20 years without stirring from his fort of Kal-Saitharak to ravish Anuire.  Those who think they know how to prepare are doing so now.  The truly wise understand there is little they can do if the Gorgon comes rampaging again.
^F02 
^F06Today in the Northern Marches 
^F02 
	A rumor circulating throughout Dhoesone claims that scouts have seen Rjurik clans massing near the northern borders of the domain.  They're getting ready to break into the Northern Marches in an attempt to push the Anuireans south of the Stonecrowns.  
^F02 
	Reports trickling back to Dhoesone's baroness indicate that this massing is a peaceable gathering of the clans, not a war party.  Still, unease seeps through the populace like the very mists of Dhoesone.
^F02 
	As if the possible Rjurik threat weren't enough, goblin armies have been spotted training in the mountains of both the Five Peaks and Markazor.  The kingdom of Thurazor remains quiet, though -- ominously so.  Perhaps the humanoid troops simply want to prepare themselves for the Gorgon's attack -- or maybe they're readying to blaze through Anuire.

	Law:	The baroness holds half the kingdom's law, and the domain's guilds the other half.
	Temples:	Three temples dominate Dhoesone: the Oaken Grove of Aeric, Haelyn's Bastion of Truth, and the Northern Reformed Church of Sarimie.  The Bastion, though foremost now, is losing its grasp rapidly.
	Guilds:	Mheallie Bireon from Cariele, Adaere Doneim (MA; T5; Re, minor, 17; CE), Galien Thuried (MA; T4; Br, tainted, 12; CN), Bannier Andien (MA; T7; An, minor, 21; LE), and Storm Holtson of Stjordvik all struggle fiercely to dominate the foresting guilds of Dhoesone.  Though they dislike each other, they join forces to thwart the baroness when she tries to pass anti-lumbering laws.  These ruffians' combined influence has made life more oppressive for the average citizen.
	Sources:	The mages Clumine (MA; W3; Vo, major, 25; LG) and Daeric (MA; W3; An, minor, 20; CG) Dhoesone are cousins and rivals.  These two relatives of Fhiele Dhoesone hate each other almost as much as they love the baroness.
^F02 
Regency Generated/Accumulated:	33/21 RP.
Treasury:	14 GB.
^F02 
Army
Dhoesone's army is not large.  The local militia amounts to one unit of irregulars; though more residents would like to join, the baroness can not afford to equip them.  The forces consist of:
	1 unit of irregulars.
	2 units of elf archers.
	1 unit of elf cavalry.
	1 unit of goblin infantry.
	2 units of knights.
^F02 
Fhiele Dhoesone pays maintenance for the irregulars and the goblin infantry only; the other units are gifts from the kingdom of Tuarhievel and various
^F02 
Anuirean domains -- these kingdoms consider Dhoesone too important to let fall due to lack of money to pay defenders.
^F02 
Regent:	Fhiele Dhoesone (F1/2E; T6; Re, major, 46; N)
The baroness rules Dhoesone.  She's the daughter of the old Baron of Dhoesone and the former Queen of Tuarhievel.  Some call the partnership between her parents nothing more than a diplomatic move, but while the queen still lived, humans had little to fear in Tuarhievel.  Now, that kingdom's climate has grown harsher for Anuireans who would travel the elven wood.
^F02 
The proud, pragmatic Fhiele Dhoesone bears the burdens of rulership well.  However, some say her power slips in the face of the guilds that dominate Dhoesone's trade.  A master thief, she battles with the guilds of the realm for control.
^F02 
Lieutenants
The baroness's lieutenants include her two human mage cousins, each of whom will do whatever he can to aid her without helping the other.  One of them, a very loyal human relative Mage Clumine Dhoesone (MA; W3;Vo, major, 25; LG), struggles with others to maintain the order in the realm.  Because of his deeds, he has a reputation as a kind and fair man.
^F02 
Also, the old baron left behind his trusted adviser, Helaene Dosiere, a relation to the Chamberlain of the Imperial Capital.  She manages to accomplish impossible tasks routinely.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Helaene Dosiere, though unblooded, oversees much of the kingdom's operations.  She is largely the reason the guilds do not gain more power than they already hold.
Another personage of note is the half-elf Rhuimach Taeline, a 6th-level ranger whose knowledge of the land and intuitive grasp of strategy has kept the Giantdowns's inhabitants from overpowering the kingdom.
^F02 
Description
Half windswept moor and half pine forest, Dhoesone seems a land barely tamed.  Despite its numerous logging camps, it remains home to elf tribes rumored to live among the pines.  The people of the forest act secretive and keep to themselves -- they can feel the guilds' presence among them, and they know a wrong word can cause a "logging accident" for them or their families.  Still, to those who have gained their trust, the people of Dhoesone appear friendly and sometimes even helpful -- in particular to those who work against the guilds.
^F02 
The people of the moor are shepherds, ever wary of natural dangers like peat bogs, ravines, Rjurik hunters, and roaming giants.  This hardy breed, accustomed to the wind and harsh land, lives a life only vaguely Anuirean.  Instead, these folk seek to emulate the nearby Rjuriks.  Though insular, they will share their unique knowledge with travelers -- for the right coin.
^F02 
Capital
The capital of Dhoesone is the city Sonnelind, located in the central province of the same name.  Though not a big city, it's one of the largest north of the Stonecrowns.
^F02 
Trade Goods
The products of Dhoesone include wool-based goods and lumber.  The trade of animal hides thrives here, too, but the baroness has forbidden the overhunting of certain species.  Naturally, this law only adds to the value of the pelts.  Nolien, on the bay, holds a seaport that leads to Ice Haven in Talinie.  One of the largest roads in Anuire leads south from Sonnelind through Cariele.
^F02 
Allies
Since Dhoesone's odd pact with the goblin king of Thurazor, trade has flowed freely between the two kingdoms.  Of course, since the goblins raid every few years, the two kingdoms must renew the pact periodically.  Some say the baroness has traded away part of her guild interest in the hopes of retaining this treaty.  The goblins provide one infantry unit for her army as part of this pact; in return for taking these sometimes less than model soldiers off the goblin king's hands, the king welcomes goods of Dhoesone into Thurazor.
^F02 
The baroness has also made a pact with her older half-brother Fhileraene, Prince of Tuarhievel; this agreement allows her to cease fearing for at least one of her borders.  He has even sent a force of elf knights to help defend her kingdom -- but are his motives wholly pure?
^F02 
Enemies
The one bordering kingdom with which Dhoesone has consistently maintained poor relations is, strangely, Cariele.  The only other Anuirean kingdom in the area tries to outdo Dhoesone in everything and blocks the baroness's actions through means both legal and illegal.  The only apparent reason for this behavior is that Dhoesone denied the suit of Entier Gladanil, Cariele's regent.
^F02 
As always, Dhoesone also faces danger from the Giantdowns and the Barony of the Crimson Skull in Rjurik's lands.  The monsters these domains spawn frequently march on Dhoesone.
Special Conditions
^F02 
Not all the elves here recognize humans as friends.  Hunters and adventurers are often slain if they wander into the wrong areas of the wood.  Travelers usually stick to the main roads.

^F02 
Regent:	Entier Gladanil (MA; F5; An, minor, 20; NE)
He has recently ascended to the throne of the County of Cariele.  Locals say his father never adjusted the law enough to suit the guilds' interests, or interceded for these guilds when other kingdoms closed their borders to them.  Entier has learned his lesson; he allows the guilds plenty of leeway, and signs whatever the guildmasters place in front of him.  This weak-willed fop spends most of his kingdom's income building up his castle and his wardrobe.
^F02 
Lieutenants
The only lieutenants in Cariele are the ones appointed by the guilds.  One of these, Guildmaster Mheallie Bireon (FA; T8; Br, major, 37; NE), is the most ruthless guild leader in all of Anuire and the true power of the kingdom.  She controls all three of the local guilds.  She is skilled with bladed weapons and bows to no one.
^F02 
Provinces
The kingdom's capital, Caerlinien, though technically in Riverford, sits at the intersection of all three provinces, in the dead center of Cariele.
^F02 
Important NPCs
The thief Mheallie Bireon (FA; T8; Br, major, 37; NE) remains the true power behind the throne.  Though three guilds operate in Cariele (one for each province) each of them report to Bireon.  She controls them all like a great spider handles its web, twitching a strand here and there to keep the web constantly moving.  She's the most ruthless guild leader in Anuire, bar none -- perhaps that's why she sits at the top of her profession.  Currently, she's trying to muscle out her competition in Dhoesone, but for the first time in her life she faces some serious opposition from guilders Bannier Andien, Storm Holtson, Adaere Doneim, and Gaelin Thuried.
^F02 
There's not much need for magic in Cariele, kingdom of commerce.  The fact that most of the magic of the land has disappeared with the forest discourages mages from moving here.
^F02 
Temples to Aeric and Haelyn used to hold sway in this domain, but they have fallen in favor of the temples of Sarimie.  The people have learned to stop putting their faith in ideals, instead preferring a god that exemplifies more physical pursuits.  The Northern Reformed Church of Sarimie, run by the priestess Larra Nieliems (FA; Pr8, Sarimie; Br, major, 32; NE), is the dominant faith of Cariele.
^F02 
Description
With only a small, hilly gap in the Stonecrown Mountains connecting the kingdom to the rest of Anuire, Cariele almost saved the Northern lands from conquest.  Only by sea or through this gap in the Stonecrowns could the Anuirean army pass into the Marches.
^F02 
In this narrow mountain pass, the entire second Anuirean army met its death, as an elven ambush rained sharp-tipped death upon the troops.  Eventually, another Anuirean detachment managed to reach the peaks overlooking the gorge, but not before suffering additional losses.  Ever since, Anuirean forces have watched the gap with a hawklike eye.  The memory of the ambush lives on in both human and elf memory.  The humans call the mountain pass Mhelliviene, or "the Gates of Doom," while the elves name it Toriendor Cuachlimyr: "Fools' Passage."
^F02 
Cariele was once gorgeous country, with towering trees rising high above the land.  Now, under the rule of Gladanil and Bireon, the provinces have been stripped down and harvested of their resources.  Roads cross the land, and stumps of trees dot the landscape as far as the eye can see in Riverford.  Where fur used to provide the bulk of the domain's income, now the timber trade thrives throughout the county.  Members of the guilds have planted quick-growth trees for future harvesting, which has begun to bring the animals back tentatively.
^F02 
The winds in Cariele blow hard and cold from the Tael Firth and the North, blasting the northern face of the Stonecrowns.  Those who live here have grown hard and tough, fighting the winds and working with their axes in the forests all day.  These locals don't seem to care for anyone but themselves and can't be bothered by strangers.  In return, Carieleans find they receive precious little interest from the rest of Anuire.

Regent:	Tie'skar Graecher (MG; F7; Az, minor, 24; LE)
His Most Eminent Highness rules the kingdom of Thurazor.  He wrested it from the ruler before him and expects to have it taken violently from him by one of his own soldiers -- but he has a few tricks up his sleeve for any would-be usurpers.  Graecher's a crafty old goblin king.
See Tie'shar Graecher
^F02 
Lieutenants
Graecher keeps the shaman Kral Two-Toes (MG; Pr6; Az, tainted, 10; LE) with him to dispense justice and keep the people in line with threats of divine wrath.  The King of Thurazor doesn't trust Kral, but does allow the shaman something of a free rein, as he wants to maintain favor with the more fanatic goblins.  He also sends this lieutenant him to deal with minor kingdom matters from time to time.
^F02 
Provinces
The six provinces of Thurazor have been explored hardly at all by Anuireans, despite the prime lumber and magical sources available.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Though Graecher doesn't realize it, both Cariele's and Dhoesone's guilds want to ensure that the kingdom runs smoothly, to protect their revenues.  In this matter, the guilds work together, though any domain with a guild presence must expect some back-stabbing.
^F02 
Kral knows that shrines to human gods lie hidden in the realm.  The temples, growing stronger all the time, cater to goblins sick of the constant bloodshed and hatred that the goblin god preaches.  The shaman has no idea of these temples' locations, but he thinks he's closing in.  When he finally finds them, he will sacrifice the heathen goblins with abandon.
^F02 
Description
Without a doubt, Thurazor is the most civilized of all the goblin kingdoms in Anuire.  Though inhabitants exploit its lands, the domain seems in better condition than the other kingdoms.  The goblins try to maintain their environment -- they even attempt to replace the trees they cut and cover the mines they dig, once they've extracted the minerals.  The goblins' concern for their surroundings is something no Cerilian ever would have expected.
^F02 
Of course, this consideration doesn't mean the residents of Thurazor have turned from their evil ways -- far from it.  It's just that their king has diverted their attention from war and carnage to other fields, such as trade, that profit him more.  His subjects understand this royal manipulation, but they appear afraid to counter it -- Graecher pays his enforcers well indeed.  So the goblins here labor away, mining and foresting, while the more violent ones slip away into the Five Peaks or Dhoesone to form mercenary companies.
^F02 
This pattern suits the King of Thurazor just fine.  It not only rids his kingdom of poor laborers, it also removes those most likely to threaten his throne.  Chances are good that they'll get themselves killed in one foreign war or another, and Graecher won't have to worry about them ever again.  If too many of his people start becoming violent, the king figures he can always start a war with one of his neighbors, then sue for peace when enough troublemakers have fallen by the way.
^F02 
His capricious attitude toward treaties makes dealings with Thurazor difficult.  The domain's neighbors have learned they can trust the goblins to stick to an agreement as long as it remains expedient for the goblin king.  It's a credit to Graecher's guile and ability to inspire confidence that he continues to rewrite treaties with his neighbors, all the while making his offerings appear invaluable.
^F02 
The goblins of Thurazor have become fair woodsmen, giving up their mountain lore and adapting to the forest.  Though they'll never become as accomplished as the elves in moving through the woodlands, they can creep through the forest without making undue noise.  The best of them leave to become scouts and spies for the human realms; some even study under human rangers!

^F02 
Army
The army of Tuarhievel is composed completely of elves, as follows:
	7 units of elf archers.
	3 units of elf cavalry.
^F02 
This army could repel the Gorgon's tentative advances, but likely would not stand against a full invasion.  The prince would like to remedy this weakness, so the elves of Tuarhievel remain on constant alert.  The kingdom can rally an additional three units of elf archers and two units of elf cavalry only one war move after an attack.
^F02 
Regent:	Prince Fhileraene, (ME; F/W 7/7; Re, great, 55; N)
The ruler of the last elf domain in the Aelvinnwode is Fhileraene, Prince of Tuarhievel (ME; F/W 7/7; Re, great, 55; N).  The prince's mother, the queen Ibelcoris, was the granddaughter of the elf warrior Rhuobhe.  Some have said that Fhileraene bears a remarkable resemblance to Rhuobhe Manslayer, but it remains to be seen whether the prince has inherited more than Rhuobhe's looks.  The bloodline of Fhileraene contains both the blood of Reynir and Azrai, but the blood of the old druid god runs slightly stronger.
^F02 
Fhileraene seems an enigma to all around him.  While he entertains traders from human lands, he also holds court with the most hate-filled of the elves.  He loves life, a quality one normally associates with elves, but he also flies into moods of black rage.  Though smooth and handsome, his demeanor hides lines of ugliness and hatred just beneath the surface.  Only his half-sister, the Baroness of Dhoesone, knows his thoughts, and she shares them with no one.
^F02 
Fhileraene, one of the strongest wizards in Anuire, gives other realms no reason to fear.  But, as the antihuman faction in his court grows, neighboring realms might regret their proximity.
^F02 
Lieutenants
The advisers of the old queen play only minor roles in the court of Tuarhievel; the prince seeks to accomplish nearly everything himself.  The tasks he can not complete, he assigns to his childhood companion, Llytha Damaan (FE; W/T 6/6; Vo, major, 34; N).  This beautiful and capable elf is a mage of no small power and a thief of equal skill (W6/T6).  This accomplished diplomat's honeyed tongue can sway even the most stubborn elf.
^F02 
Important NPCs
The elf nobles play an essential part in the kingdom.  Blooded or unblooded, they come to the Council of the Moon to offer guidance and receive redress to their complaints.  The most influential family, House Tuarlachiem, also seeks to exterminate all humans in the Aelvinnwode.  House matriarch Rhuandice Tuarlachiem (FE; F9; Re, major, 30; N) seems particularly vehement in her demands.
^F02 
Description
Tuarhievel, the last elf kingdom in the Aelvinnwode, remains a place of dark forest and brooding beauty, nearly the equal of the Erebannien in its appeal.  The swells of its hilly landscape bring to mind a sea of trees.
^F02 
However, danger waits among these trees for those who lose their appointed way; countless faerie clearings can lure humans to their doom.  The natural world holds sway in Tuarhievel, making it a place of great magic.  Even the dullest human can feel the eldritch power here -- a power only fools would challenge.
^F02 
Capital
Tuarhievel revolves around the Thorn Throne, a single plant carefully tended and shaped into a comfortable chair -- for those found worthy.  It's said the Thorn Throne will pierce anyone deemed inappropriate to sit in it.  In the spring and summer, white and red roses bloom within its woody tendrils, while fall and winter find it bare.  The throne stands under a canopy of leaves, in a clearing of oaks designed to resemble a great hall.  This, Fhileraene's capital, is in the province of Cwmbheir.
^F02 
Trade Goods
Weapons and armor of elven manufacture always seem popular outside Tuarhievel -- and also expensive.  Musical instruments, wood carvings, and statuary constitute the kingdom's main exports.  Traders can reach Cwmbheir via roads from Sonnelind in Dhoesone or Caerlinien in central Cariele.  Merchants leaving the road become prime targets for the fair folk's whimsy.
^F02 
Allies
Tuarhievel's allies include Dhoesone and the Sielwode.  The former earns the prince's loyalty because his younger half-sister rules there.  The two have bound their realms together, allowing trade to and from Dhoesone to flow freely in Tuarhievel.  Still, most humans fear elves' wrath and steer clear of involving themselves in this realm's affairs.
^F02 
The Sielwode, as the only other elf realm in Anuire (besides Rhuobhe), is a natural ally.  Though the two countries split for a time when Tuarhievel opened its borders to humans, relations have normalized with the ascent of Fhileraene to the Thorn Throne -- and with the likelihood that the borders once again would be closed to most humans.
^F02 
Enemies
Naturally, sharing a border with the Gorgon's Crown means that Fhileraene must feel strongly about the awnshegh one way or another.  As a past victim of the Gorgon's wrath, Tuarhievel views the abomination as his most dire enemy.  The prince has sworn to find a way to destroy the awnshegh before it again rampages through the elf kingdom.
^F02 
Special Conditions
The gheallie Sidhe, or Hunt of the Elves, still roams parts of Tuarhievel.  Though the prince has stated his official displeasure with those involved, the Hunt continues to take place during the darkest of nights.  Occasionally, human caravans disappear on the road to the Thorn Throne.  Even elf trackers the prince appoints to conduct searches have no luck finding them -- though they might have orders to fail.
Because of the anguish arising from human murders, some say the Shadow World presses close in parts of Tuarhievel.  In the heavy, wooded darkness, ghosts and spectres rise from where they were slain, seeking the elves responsible for their deaths.  Likewise, the elven dead walk again to wreak havoc on humans who have despoiled these lands.  Most elves and traders lock themselves securely away on such nights -- one rarely has the opportunity to ignore the peril of the Shadow World a second time.

Army
The Gorgon's army strikes fear into the heart of any regent within three kingdoms.  The masses of troops nurse only their ill intent.  Though quiescent for now, the army will move again, and all Anuire will tremble in terror under the Gorgon's cloven foot.  This force includes:
	4 units of dwarf guards.
	3 units of dwarf crossbows.
	5 units of goblin infantry.
	4 units of goblin cavalry.
	3 units of gnoll infantry.
	3 units of gnoll marauders.
	3 units of mercenary infantry.
	2 units of mercenary cavalry.
	2 units of mercenary pikemen.
	1 unit of scouts.
^F02 
Rumors also whisper that the Gorgon employs giant-kin, including fhoimorien, in his army.  One report even places a dragon with these forces!
^F02 
Regent:	The Gorgon
The awnshegh rules the Gorgon's Crown with a fist tighter than iron.  Once called Raesene, the half-brother of Haelyn and Roele, the Gorgon found himself lured to the side of evil with the blandishments of Azrai.  None proved abler than the Black Prince in the strategies of evil.  He quickly rose to become the champion of Azrai and absorbed much of the god's essence at Deismaar.  All Cerilians consider him the first and mightiest of the awnsheghlien.
^F02 
It was the Gorgon who halted the advances of the Anuirean armies under Roele, and the Gorgon who tore apart the Anuirean Empire by killing its last emperor, Michael.  His crimes, too many and heinous to name, grow as his evil multiplies every day.  He keeps contact with the two new gods of evil, Kriesha and Belinik, and secretly lusts after their power, though he has yet to find a way to take it.  He owns at least two of the 12 tighmaevril weapons (and perhaps as many as four), taken from the bodies of those stupid enough to challenge him in his place of power.
^F02 
Though the Gorgon has great power -- perhaps more than any other creature in the world -- he remains a master of subtlety, deceit, and lies.  He carefully crafts rumors to destroy kingdoms and grind bloodlines into the dust.  He plans his political moves with patience only a 2,000-year-old being can muster.  Those living on his border claim he can see the future.
^F02 
Anuireans say the awnshegh harvests bloodlines like a vintner harvests grapes -- with great care and deliberation.  He helps the scions of an individual line grow ever more powerful, and then subtly encourages them to seek him out.  Only a few have provided even modest entertainment, but all have nourished his personal bloodline.
^F02 
Lieutenants
It has been said that evil turns in on itself.  As a firm believer in this adage, the Gorgon doesn't want to become a victim of such inevitable betrayal; therefore, he replaces his lieutenants every decade, or whenever he thinks they've become too ambitious for their own good.  One of his current lieutenants, a crusty old dwarf named Kiras Earthcore, hails from the realm of Mur-Kilad.  This master tactician and fierce warrior hates the Gorgon with all his heart.  He has planned a careful treachery to repay the monster for his years of servitude -- a plan that now nears fruition.  Kiras thinks the Gorgon doesn't suspect a thing.
^F02 
Important NPCs
No other important nonplayer characters live in the Gorgon's Crown.  Some scouts have ventured far into the abomination's domain, but only one of them appears willing to make the journey again: Timaeras Bachie seems insane enough to dare it.  Some claim this cunning and headstrong fellow is more than a little unbalanced.  He's said to know the Gorgon's Crown in all its details and can guide explorers to its heart -- but who would be foolish enough to want him to make the attempt?
^F02 
Description
The Gorgon's Crown, the largest kingdom in Anuire, borders Brecht and Rjurik territory.  Covered in mountains and hills, the Gorgon's domain encompasses some of the most forbidding land in Anuire.  High peaks carry snow year round, and steep slopes drop loads of loose rock periodically into the sheer ravines below.  Rogue towers pepper the kingdom, manned by twisted humans and goblins seeking to curry favor.  Volcanic activity is uncommon, but occasionally the lurid glow of spouting magma fills the sky, and rains of ash sweep across the land for weeks.
^F02 
Capital
The province Kal-Saitharak takes its name from the capital of the Gorgon's Crown, known in Anuire as the Battlewaite.  This obsidian and iron fortress sits in the forested province between two volcanoes; its spiky spires and towers seem to rise just as high into the reddish sky as the volcanoes nearby.
^F02 
Trade Goods
The Gorgon does not trade with anyone.  What he desires, he takes.  He uses the Fellport harbor on the Dauren Arm as his major sea access.
^F02 
Allies
This abomination controls the kingdom of Kiergard in Brechtur, plus Mur-Kilad and Markazor.  Though they each maintain a nominal ruler, none may act with true autonomy.  And, apart from those three, no kingdom will deal with the Gorgon.
^F02 
Enemies
Any person not a vassal or servant of the Gorgon is his enemy.  Any kingdom not under his direct control becomes a foe.  Consequently, nearly all of Anuire stands as the declared enemy of the Gorgon.  Yet, hardly any kingdoms willingly take action against the most ancient of the awnsheghlien.  They fear his periodic rampages, and they remain unwilling to join forces to crush him -- the last group of regents that attempted to take the Gorgon's life vanished.
^F02 
Special Conditions
Folks say the Gorgon knows every footstep that transgresses upon his domain.  Folks also say he flies and eats small children, though, so this rumor may hold no truth.  However, anyone who would travel into the Gorgon's Crown should remember that no one in five centuries has offered the awnshegh even a slight challenge.

The Five Peaks has no single regent.  The provinces actually remain separate kingdoms, each controlled by bandits, goblins, or orogs.  They struggle with each other continuously, a microcosm of Anuire itself.  The rulers seem to change weekly, as inferiors work their treachery and the various tribes lose members in battle.  In this constant change of power, bloodlines have nothing to do with who rules.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Each province of the Five Peaks has its own hierarchy, which may or may not include lieutenants.  The chiefs of the human brigands usually have at least a single trusted lieutenant.  The goblin tribes often do not, for they have grown up mistrusting the others of their race.  Orogs follow a single chieftain unquestioningly until the time comes to challenge that chieftain.
^F02 
Provinces
There are seven divisions within the Five Peaks: No regent would want to rule the whole domain.
^F02 
Important NPCs
The Eyeless One (?; W9; Vo, major, 35; CE) is said to control all the magic of this realm.  The Five Peaks certainly appears a potent magical source, though the domain's inhabitants have little tolerance for wielders of magic.  Still, the Eyeless One maintains a tower hidden in The Gorge.  Though the denizens have tried to dislodge him (or her?) many times, none has been successful.Sometimes, a representative from one of the tribes comes to the Eyeless One for aid against one enemy or another.  The wizard generally will help -- for a price.  But beware in dealing with this dark mage: Heart-wrenching screams from those in debt to the Eyeless One have been heard coming from the wizard's tower, lit by flashes of eerie, dark light.  Goblin bands that seek aid here often vanish entirely after a few months.  Clearly, visiting the Eyeless One remains a last-ditch effort.
^F02 
Some remember a temple to Cuiraecen in the Five Peaks; folks also think the Vos gods hold sway here.  In truth, the domain's religious foundation probably amounts to nothing more than a couple priests hoping to convert the brigands -- an attempt doomed to fail.
^F02 
Description
The Five Peaks contain some of the most rugged terrain in Anuire, including five of the most forbidding mountains in the region.  Set along the range between the Seamists and the Stonecrowns, this kingdom is the original spawning grounds of the goblins and orogs that so plagued the dwarves and elves of ancient Cerilia.  Today the creatures harbor more evil intent than most might guess.  Though no awnsheghlien live in the Five Peaks, travelers still risk plenty of hazards.  Besides the brigands, goblins, and orogs, rumors populate the domain with griffons and giant tribes, as well.  Many have spotted the dragon Lifesbane touching down on peaks in this realm.
^F02 
These mountains boast precious little greenery; what little there is, the local bands have foraged for firewood, grazing, or weapons.  Since most consider these peaks a scoundrel's last refuge in Anuire -- and the place where restless goblins go to escape the goblin king's tyranny -- few residents hold regard for the law or other people.  Self-preservation requires friends though, so, they form bands whose members kill on sight to get what they want.

Mur-Kilad Regent:	Godar Thurinson (MD; F6; Vo, tainted, 5; LE)
Markazor Regent:	Razzik Fanggrabber (FG; F4; Az, tainted, 2; LE)
Godar Thurinson and Razzik Fanggrabber
The regents of these two puppet states, though mortal enemies, do not seem so different.  The first, Godar Thurinson of Mur-Kilad (MD; F6; Vo, tainted, 5; LE) is a blustery dwarf with nothing but contempt for nondwarves.  Razzik Fanggrabber (FG; F4; Az, tainted, 2; LE), Queen of Markazor, grew to adulthood taught to regard all others as blood enemies of the goblins.  Their master, the Gorgon, has given them strict orders to work together to produce the fiercest army Cerilia has ever seen.  The two therefore have united their forces under pain of death, and now dwarves and goblins train side by side.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Several subordinate goblins and dwarves would like nothing more than to step into leadership spots; the Gorgon always has replacements for the old leaders groomed and waiting.
^F02 
Provinces
Markazor encompasses seven provinces, while Mur-Kilad has only two.  Anuireans call them puppet states for good reason: The Gorgon controls the placement of all resources and armies.
^F02 
Important NPCs
The only significant NPC in these realms is the Gorgon.  No trade takes place between either kingdom and the rest of Anuire; all they produce goes directly to the Gorgon's Crown, in return for which they receive permission to raid caravans for food.
^F02 
A mage hiding in Mur-Kilad uses the mountains to power strange magic, but no one knows whether this Peak Mage (FA; W8; An, major, 32; N) works for or against the Gorgon.
^F02 
Description
Land in Markazor and Mur-Kilad is harsh and rough.  These domains have suffered greatly from goblin and dwarf mining efforts for the manufacture of weapons for the Gorgon's armies.  The trees have been harvested, the rivers polluted, and the mountains cored.  Still the populace combs the land for more resources.  The puppet states have no cities, just small towns situated to best serve the Gorgon's war effort, moving as the abomination's strategy changes.  Those living in these temporary towns always feel displaced.
^F02 
Both the goblins and the dwarves seem sullen, resentful of the Gorgon's power over them.  Just because they live together doesn't mean they like each other -- in fact, each race has come to hate the other even more over time.  The coals of this animosity remain banked, but it won't take much to bring the flame to the fore.  Since the penalty for fighting within the ranks is death, the two peoples live in peace for now.  However, their resentment comes through in their dealings with others.  Both races always seem actively hostile to visitors, ready to leap into a fight with little provocation.
^F02 
The dwarves originally chose their monster-infested kingdom so they could protect the entire land from orog incursions.  The Gorgon's arrival changed all that, and orogs now roam the area, bullying at whim.
^F02 
^F06Other Domains
^F02 
Any priest, thief, and wizard domains in the Northern Marches can be characterized by one thing: greed.  Though the region's major temple and guild networks gain wealth at others' expense, the most powerful wizard tempers his hunger for power with rational thinking.
^F02 
Anuireans have so little information about many Northern domains that the strengths of various holdings here often remain unknown.
^F02 
^F05Temples
^F02 
The two most influential temples of the North are the Oaken Grove of Aeric and the Northern Reformed Church of Sarimie, though some temples to other gods lie scattered about the land.  Also, since most Northern domains fall under nonhuman control, few human temples have any influence here.

^F06The Eastern Marches
^F02 
Travelers trying to describe their visit to the Eastern Marches generally can't do the job without using the word diverse.  Unpredictable usually comes up, too.
^F02 
To the north in the Marches lies the Sielwode, a savage forest never tempered by the hand of man.  Massive herds tended by a couple of landrunners graze in the central portion of the Eastern region.  Wild horses race across its southern plains, which gradually give way to wetlands, where a traveler can find himself mired in swamps and quicksand before he realizes what's happened.  The thick canopy of leaves prevents light from reaching the sodden ground, and fierce storms occasionally lash the land, breaking what will not bend.
^F02 
These Eastern lands, positioned on the shores of the Gulf of Coeranys, form a bridge between Anuire and the rest of Cerilia.  They hold the few known land-based routes into Brechtur and Khinasi, though traversing the passes presents more risks than most traders care to bear.  The Sielwode blocks passage to Brechtur, and the Chimaera's lands encompass the pass to the Khinasi.  It's not hard to see why Anuirean traders have taken to the waters.  It's also not hard to see why the rest of Anuire has left the Eastern Marches mostly to their own devices.
^F02 
Some say the Eastern Marches appear the least "Anuirean" of all Anuire's lands.  Perhaps it's because of the Khinasi influence drifting in from farther east, or simply because Eastern regents tend not to display the back-stabbing tactics so favored by the other rulers of the land.  The regents of this area seem more inclined toward nonaggression and diplomacy, rather than brute force and huge armies.
The people of the East echo this attitude.  They seem even tempered, hard to provoke, and generally act friendly toward strangers.  Of course, this is not to say they let others push them around; it's just that they remain pleasant as they refuse an outsider's dictates.  These individualists, though less rugged than Northern Marchers, are civilized and more artistically inclined than other Anuireans.  Despite the fact that the area offers precious little wood or stone, the greatest crafters in the history of the land have hailed from the Eastern Marches.
^F02 
The main industry of the East is the raising and selling of horses and cattle.  Stallions from the kingdom of Coeranys fetch high prices across Anuire; horses trained by the regent's own staff bring in even more.  Naturally, these horses become prime targets for raids by elves or human bandits, and Coeranian herders remain hard-pressed to keep the raiders at bay.  Some herders will give their lives to protect their livelihood -- dozens die each year in skirmishes with horse thieves.
^F02 
The swamps of the East are poorly mapped and little known.  The area's major swamps number only three: Hope's Demise in Elinie, the Sunken Lands on the border of Osoerde and Coeranys, and Spiritsend in Osoerde.  Some say witches call these swamps home, luring people in to consume them and their spirits.  Others think the legendary dragon Swampsblood constitutes the true danger of the swamps, though no one has spotted the reptile for years.  Regardless, all Easterners consider the swamps places of danger and ill omen to avoid at all costs.
^F02 
^F06Today in the Eastern Marches
^F02 
	Well, not all locals avoid the swamps.  Some fearless individuals make their livings venturing there to collect rare herbs and wood, so scarce on the Eastern plains.  Escaped criminals sometimes find learning to live off the swamps preferable to swinging from the gallows pole.  Still others work as guides and scouts, leading hunters and treasure seekers into the swamps in search of big game or riches.
^F02 
	The greatest threats in the East come from the Chimaera living nearby and from Khinasi raiders.  Ghoere's expansionist urges make that domain to the west an ever-present threat, too.  Finally, elves still carry on the gheallie Sidhe from the safety of their Sielwode homeland.
^F02 
	The elves, meanwhile, have to contend with the goblins of Markazor and the dwarves of Mur-Kilad, both of whom grow steadily bolder with each passing season.  The elf knights can not hope to keep all these armies in check.  Some folks whisper that goblin forces have nearly penetrated the heart of the Sielwode, so the woodland demihumans might seek even human support soon.
^F02 
	The dwarven kingdoms of the East face their own dangers, as well.  The dwarves of Baruk-Azhik maintain their ancient vigil on the orog beneath the Iron Peaks, working ever harder to contain the brutish humanoids under the earth, so they can not threaten surface dwellers.  Every year, the orogs mount another expedition to reach the world above, and lately their growing strength has been taxing the dwarves unduly.  Soon they may not be able to continue withstanding their staggering annual losses.

Army
Naturally, Baruk-Azhik protects itself with an all-dwarf army.  The dwarves do insist on receiving some payment for their services -- they've got homes to live in and forges they could be working at, after all -- but they agree to accept just a minimal payment.  Most units actually concentrate on maintaining security around the orog tunnels and have not necessarily readied themselves for an invasion from without.  Baruk-Azhik's army contains:
	4 units of dwarf guards.
	4 units of dwarf crossbows.
^F02 
Two more units of each type become available one war move after war is declared, as dwarves will leave their labors in droves to defend their beloved lands.
^F02 
Regent:	Grimm Graybeard (MD; F/Pr 7/8; An, major, 38; LG)
The Overthane of Baruk-Azhik seems a dour dwarf, whose main concern in life is containing the orogs under the Iron Peaks.  He acts friendly to proven friends of the dwarven cause and supports his people's ventures enthusiastically, but finds little reason to seek companions outside his own race.
^F02 
He does not disdain humans, but he wants them to prove their worth before he trusts them with any task or treasure of value.  Indeed, he has known some excellent humans in his time, and part of the mission he gives his trading parties is to scout out likely humans for future recruitment to the fortresses of Baruk-Azhik.
See Grimm Graybeard
^F02 
Lieutenants
Graybeard has four lieutenants, each with the honorary title "thane" and the power to make decisions for the kingdom.  The thanes each also head a clan, so they must answer to the people as well as their overthane.  Each thane governs his clan's province, leaving the regent free to respond to their most serious concerns.
^F02 
A close friend of the Overthane is Diirk Watershold (MD; T10; An, minor, 29; NG), who is a very bright, jocular fellow and the leader of  Baruk-Azhik's defenses.  He is in charge of an extensive spy network and head of the powerful Royal Guild.  Watershold is friendly to outsiders but devoted to the dwarf realm.
^F02 
Important NPCs
A close friend of Grimm Graybeard, Diirk Watershold ("That's ODiirk' with two i's!") is the dwarf most likely to encounter outsiders.  As the head of Baruk-Azhik's trading guild, he deals with Anuireans who fight the elements (and the terrain) to trade with the dwarves.
^F02 
This jocular fellow can coldly appraise a person's worth with a glance.  Diirk is not only a trader, but a thief of the highest quality.  He leads Baruk-Azhik's internal defenses, as his spy network stretches into Coeranys and Osoerde.  Grimm Graybeard relies on Diirk's reports and his goodwill.
^F02 
Description
As one might expect of a dwarf kingdom, Baruk-Azhik is mountainous country.  Snow-covered peaks and treacherous gorges mark this domain, defying any who would traverse it.  The air feels crisp and thin in the upper reaches of the mountains, and the wind can chill a traveler to the bone.  Rivers race through the ravines, carving their way through the rock as they've done for millennia.  Hardy aspens cling to the earth, and shrubs cover the entire landscape.  The Iron Peaks protect neighboring Khinasi from the worst of Anuire's weather -- which means Baruk-Azhik is buffeted all the worse.  The howling of the winds, like lost spirits in these ranges, makes locals whisper that those who lose their lives in the mountains must inhabit the wind for all time.
^F02 
The dwarves have done little to mar the outer surface of the mountains -- instead, they concentrate on building fortresses within.  Each province has one such fortress, the home of a single clan.  Though the crags outside may grow rough and battered by wind, the interiors of each clanhome are truly marvels.
^F02 
Though most folks know dwarves as masters of stonework, they have no idea how the race has consummated its art in these fortresses.  Great stone blocks hold together with hardly a crack to mark their joining.  The ceilings and pillars of the common areas gleam, so well burnished that the rock itself seems to glow.  The living quarters and temple areas are places that humans, however trusted, may never see.  Even so, to lay eyes upon any room beyond the entry hall of a clan's holding is an honor greater than most Anuireans ever enjoy.
^F02 
Capital
Baruk-Azhik's capital, Stone's Rejoicing, is located in Rivenrock, the province the overthane rules personally.  All matters of justice the thanes can not decide come before Graybeard here.  This settlement has become the domain's center of trade.
^F02 
Trade Goods
All items of dwarven manufacture remain always avidly sought by those who value true craftsmanship.  However, dwarven goods leave the kingdom only infrequently, as the dwarves tend to trade only among themselves.  Trade routes do lead down to Ruorven in Coeranys and Shieldhaven in Mhoried, though, and a secret road runs through the Sielwode into its capital, Siellaghriod.  Other trade routes include one to Moriel and one to Ilien.

Baruk-Azhik has no true allies.  Though they eventually might need such friends to help in their war against the orogs, the dwarves are too proud to ask for human alliances.  Humans, in turn, trade with the dwarves gladly, but they fear they would offend the dwarves by offering aid.
^F02 
Enemies
Except for the orogs within the mountains, the dwarves of Baruk-Azhik have no mortal enemies.  Almost as great an enemy as the orogs are the dwarves of Mur-Kilad, under the domination of the Gorgon.  A Baruk-Azhik dwarf will attack a Mur-Kilad dwarf on sight, striving to beat the other back into the earth whence it came, so the Mur-Kiladan will not offend the land with its life.  Naturally, Mur-Kilad dwarves feel wary entering battle involving other dwarves.
^F02 
Special Conditions
The orogs under the Iron Peaks grow ever more powerful with every passing year.  Every single dwarf lost becomes a victory for the orogs, whereas one lost orog seems little cause for concern to the orog rulers.  The population of Baruk-Azhik declines steadily each year, while the orogs' keeps growing.  Grimm Graybeard has begun to think the dwarves can solve the orog problem only by sweeping through the beasts' underground caverns with force.  While this tactic would mean severe dwarf losses, it also would end the orog threat -- at least, for now.

^F02 
Regent:	 Jaison Raenech (MA; F7; Br, major, 36; LE)*
* Rightful Ruler:	William Moergen (MA; F5; An, major, 35; CG)
The rightful ruler of Osoerde is William Moergen.  However, his late father's most trusted lieutenant Jaison Raenech has usurped the throne.  The self-named duke has divested the old regent of his power, leaving Moergen bereft of his father's blessing and running from bounty hunters after the reward for his death.
^F02 
The cruel duke delights in causing pain and demonstrating his own might.  This arrogant, sneering man takes excessive pride in his darkly handsome face.  He keeps his alliances secret, but all know his enemies include Coeranys and Aerenwe, both of whom despise what he's done.
^F02 
Though young, William Moergen has eyes with wisdom that belies his age.  He fled while still a teenager to avoid the headsman's blade, and now he attempts to build an army to roust the duke from power.  His youth leads one to expect a certain naivete from him; he uses this assumption to lead his enemies into his clutches.  Still, the duke has proven too canny to fall into Moergen's traps -- almost as if the usurper knew of them in advance.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Terence Gryphon leads the duke's men in their pursuit of the fugitive rightful duke.  This hard, capable man, seems as untrustworthy as his master.  The core of ambition deep within him fuels his desire to destroy Jaison Raenech as soon as he has captured and executed Moergen.
^F02 
William Moergen travels with a small band of companions.  These fellow scions and hardy commoners all enjoy the heir's implicit trust.  Each has saved his life in one way or another over the years.  With them, he is slowly gaining enough power to retake his throne.
^F02 
Provinces
The eight provinces of Osoerde are governed from the capital Moriel, located in Moriel province.  From its position in the center of the realm, the duke can ride forth with little delay to answer the needs of his people -- and to inflict punishment.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Two mages have taken over the swamps of Osoerde.  Though little is known of these two, most folks have heard them called mortal enemies -- one serves the unlawful duke, while the other aids Moergen in his quest to become regent.
^F02 
Description
Except for its southern swamps, Osoerde is a land of gentle hills and fields of golden wheat -- the terrain has little variety.  The flat countryside gradually rises upward from the eastern gulf toward the Heartlands.  Cattle and horses run here, some tame and some wild.
^F02 
These days find the duke raising castles along the kingdom's borders.  He says he wants to defend the land, but anyone who knows him realizes he intends the forts to provide a starting point for his armies to sweep across Anuire.
^F02 
The laws of Osoerde under Raenech seem harsh and unreasonable to locals, but they strive hard to obey them.  Those who fail to meet all the obligations of the law unfailingly suffer severe punishments.  The duke's two favorite chastisements these days are impalement and crucifixion.  The sight of a peasant nailed to a tree deters some travelers from entering the domain; it also keeps guild activity in the realm to an acceptable minimum.Obviously, the people feel less than happy under Jaison Raenech's rule.  On the other hand, Raenech has promised that those speaking rebellion will see their families and friends die slowly before their eyes.  He also has offered a substantial reward to anyone who turns in citizens speaking rebellion.  These two factors keep the populace cowed.
^F02 
Yet William Moergen continues to travel among the people, speaking the very words the usurper duke has forbidden the rest of them to utter.  The true duke has avoided traps set for him and kept a step or two ahead of Raenech's men, but he won't be able to do it forever.  Without aid, he'll soon meet his demise.

^F02 
Regent:	Eluvie Cariele (FA; F2; Ma, minor, 23; CG) 
This is the ruler of Coeranys.  Although her great-great-grandmother founded the domain that bears her name, the Gladanil clan ruling there has excised her family from that land gradually, until none of them remain.
^F02 
Cariele, an independent woman, demands little from her people and expects little in return.  However, she feels a deep responsibility for the welfare of the citizens and exercises her power fairly to protect their freedom.  She controls almost none of the law of her land, though she uses her law holdings (and the gold from her trade routes) to force off those who would take up the law for their own ends.
^F02 
Lieutenants
Medhlorie Haensen (FA; Pr2, Avanalae; An, major, 36; LG), the High Hierophant of the Life and Protection of Avanalae, serves as Cariele's personal aide and adviser and helps contribute regency to keep the residents of this land free.  Like the regent, she feels devoted to Coeranys and desires little more than its freedom from Osoerde and Ghoere, who seek to exploit it.
^F02 
The Captain of the Guard is a fellow named Aedric Bherenstae, a consummate horseman and swordsman.  He bears numerous scars gained protecting his regent from past attempts on her life, which would seem to put his loyalty beyond question -- except that someone has seized his wife and child.  The kidnaper will release them only if Aedric steps aside.  Obviously, the captain needs to find a way out of this bind as soon as possible.
^F02 
Provinces
The seven provinces of Coeranys remain sparsely populated, since most people have fled the kingdom's rainy environment, seeking sunnier climes.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Several guilds have established trading interests in Coeranys, but they have not yet proven themselves equal to the task of winning over a ruler hostile to their presence.  Only the guild of Baruk-Azhik, controlled by Diirk Watershold, remains fully welcome in Coeranys -- and that's only because he comes here irregularly.  Still, Watershold and Cariele have an understanding, and the dwarf brings more than gold when he comes here -- he also contributes regency to the kingdom in exchange for unknown favors.
^F02 
The Three Brother Mages who seek to conquer the magic of the Chimaeron also hold some sources in Coeranys, though they steer clear of the Sunken Lands on the Osoerde border.  Whether they do so out of respect or fear of what lies within, no one knows.
^F02 
Description
The wide, rolling country of Coeranys ends in the southeast at the gulf that bears its name.  The kingdom's terrain varies between grass and swamp, making it prime territory for raising horses and cattle.
^F02 
Those who tend the roaming herds are known as landrunners.  These rangers, trained from birth to know the animals of Coeranys, hold sole responsibility for the roaming animals of the plains.  They ward the animals from dangers both human and natural.  Landrunners reap the highest respect in Coeranys, for their work keeps money pouring into the domain.
^F02 
Storms boiling down from the mountains of Baruk-Azhik and rumbling across the Heartlands find Coeranys their eventual destination.  It's rare when a whole day remains clear, so the whole of this land remains well watered constantly.  The too-common swamps and bogs make peat gathering a normal labor.
^F02 
The inhabitants of Coeranys find themselves happily free.  The kingdom is their idea of paradise, and they'll defend it as necessary.  These passionate, dedicated people live their lives in joy.
^F02 
The capital, Ruorven, sits along the river that springs out of Elinien swampland.  Any of Elinie's goods coming down the river reach Ruorven first, enabling Coeranys to tax them as necessary.

Regent
Though it takes its name from the Chimaera, this domain is ruled only by a loose council of town and village leaders, which meets once in a while in the nominal capital, Lyssan.  They all bow to the Chimaera, said to have been a half-elf female wizard once.
^F02 
Lieutenants
The Council of Leaders employs constables and other aides.
^F02 
Provinces
The seven provinces of the Chimaeron reflect the domain's very small population.  The Chimaera spends most of her time in Ruorkhe.
^F02 
The rule action has no effect here; there's no luring people to the home of an abomination.  Only those who have nowhere else to flee remain.
^F02 
Important NPCs
Rumors claim that a temple to Nesirie hides up in the high peaks of the mountains, as well as a temple to Cuiraecen, but no one knows what lone priests might maintain them.
^F02 
Magical power permeates the Chimaeron, and mages called the Three Brothers have decided to attempt to control it.  Unfortunately, they ignore the fact that dozens of mages have tried before them, and none lived to boast of his magical prowess.  Still, the brothers continue to learn the sources of the land and don't seem too frightened of the Chimaera, who controls most of them.
^F02 
Description
The Iron Peaks run right through the Chimaeron and dominate its landscape.  Some say orogs live in these mountains, but most folks assume they've either died or moved away.
^F02 
The mountains of the Chimaeron seem less harsh than those in the Stonecrown chain, but still far too hard to cross without proper training or a guide.  The passes are unreliable, as the snows close them off for a good part of the year.  For armies, the mountains are practically impassable, and nearby Coeranys and Baruk-Azhik would not welcome troops marching through their lands to keep the passes open.  Besides, it's in the best interests of both neighbors to make sure the mountain passes remain closed -- their isolation from the lands east of the Chimaeron allows them to remain frontier kingdoms, as they wish, instead of becoming the center of busy trade routes.
^F02 
Though it's not properly a part of Anuire, wise rulers remember to beware the Chimaeron.  Not only does it house a vicious awnshegh, it also serves as a refuge for scoundrels.  Several small towns have sprung up among its provinces, each dispensing its own rough brand of justice -- the worst criminals find themselves either fed to the Chimaera or elected to office.

^F02 
Regent:	Emerald Queen Isaelie (FE; W13; Vo, major, 42; N)
She watches over the Faerie Court of the Sielwode.  Though she feels neutral toward humans and their kingdoms, she knows she must punish human encroachment harshly, lest men come to believe they can trespass on elf lands at will.
^F02 
Isaelie has held the throne for more than a hundred years, and in that time has watched the human lands slowly coalesce from openly warring kingdoms into roughly their current shape.  She knows that, despite the dangers hidden within her lands, the humans will eventually turn their gazes toward the Sielwode.  The elves won't be able to resist them for long.
^F02 
This sad queen feels the fate of her people heavily upon her shoulders.  She can act savage at times, unwilling to accept humans' immense capacity for destruction.  At these moments, she's likely to order the razing of every human settlement within 100 miles.  However, she remains struck profoundly by any sort of beauty, whether human or elven, natural or created.  Thus, she has borne several half-elf children from liaisons with beautiful human men.
^F02 
Lieutenants
In the Sielwode, Corwin Rhysdiordan (ME; R7; Re, major, 31; CG), can get anything done.  This tall, dark-haired, and bright-eyed elf awaits only the command of his queen before acting.  If anyone can convince her of a course of action, he can.  Rhysdiordan, a 7th-level ranger, has several human friends; likely his counsel keeps the queen quiet during some of her anti-human moods.
^F02 
Provinces
The nine provinces of the Sielwode remain unexplored by humans -- those with the temerity to try discover that the land itself turns against them.  The capital of the Faerie Court is Siellaghriod, or "the Heart of the Shield." At its center lies the Crystal Palace, an edifice brought up from the core of the earth by the lore of past rulers.  In this place of grandeur, a single candle held just right can illuminate the entire building.
^F02 
Important NPCs
An emissary from Rhuobhe Manslayer currently resides in the Crystal Palace.  Adara Cuamhyrcha seeks the Emerald Queen as an ally and, perhaps, a wife for her master.  She seems as much of a fanatic about humans as Rhuobhe -- but he may not have corrupted her entirely.
^F02 
Description
The Sielwode is no place for humans.  As in Tuarhievel, the woods feel dark and brooding, but the aura of menace here is palpable.  Where Tuarhievel holds little specific malice for humans, the nature of the Sielwode repels them.  Flitting faerie and slow-moving treant alike disdain contact with humans and want only to drive them from the forest or lure them into danger.  The land, while not evil, has awakened and learned hatred for mankind.
^F02 
Bogs lie in clearings across the perimeter of the land, shielded by trees until a traveler is nearly upon them.  The unwary might find themselves hip deep in quicksand before they know it.  Thorn hedges rise up between trees, blocking those who don't know the way from entering the wood.  Flowers dangle from trees, spewing a narcotic into the faces of those who pass too close -- some victims never wake from this slumber.
^F02 
But not everything in the Sielwode holds danger.  Some glens possess such beauty as to make a human die from the mere sight.  Oak groves cluster around crystal-clear pools, while roses bloom on vines that wrap tree trunks.
^F02

Regent:	Ruarch Rockhammer (MD; Pr11, Moradin; An, major, 41; LG)
Ruarch Rockhammer (MD; Pr11, Moradin; An, major, 41; LG) is the High Priest of Moradin's Forge.  He has held this position for 200 years, having inherited it from his mother.  The intense Ruarch always seeks the best for the dwarf nations, according to Moradin's will, though he tends to instinctively distrust those who don't follow Moradin.
^F02 
Description
Anuireans know very little about dwarven religion, including Moradin's Forge.  Its churches are confined to the dwarves' fortress-cities, though shrines located throughout dwarf lands provide solace for those who know where to look.
^F02 
Moradin's Forge also has holdings in Mur-Kilad.  High Priest Ruarch believes in converting the dwarves there (and thus saving them) before the overthane Grimm Graybeard's armies kill them.  These temples remain well hidden, even more so than most dwarven temples, for the Gorgon wants no independent thought in the lands it controls.

Regent
All anyone knows about this mage is that he (or she) has allied with William Moergen, usurped son of the former ruler of Osoerde.
^F02 
Description
The Second Swamp Mage seemed to appear from nowhere and took the name in mockery of the Swamp Mage serving Jaison Raenech, Duke of Osoerde.  Speculation abounds that this wizard is actually old Duriene Peracain (FA; W10; Vo, tainted, 15; NG), the court wizard of Moergen's father.  Yet Raenech claims he took Duriene's life with his own sword.
^F02 
The Second Swamp Mage seems fond of using guerilla tactics to restore William Moergen to the throne of Osoerde before the duke crushes the spirit of the populace.  The wizard casts spells to aid ailing locals and hide those who break Raenech's law.  Woe to Raenech's men who pose as Moergen sympathizers in this wizard's presence; they wind up as a heap of ashes left outside the first Swamp Mage's door.

Player characters in a Birthright campaign likely will meet blooded characters both common and royal, of all races known to Anuire.  Here is a sampling of some of the country's more important and unique nonplayer characters.  The listings for regent characters include only the equipment they usually carry; assume they have access to their kingdoms' vast treasuries for other items.

^F06Aeric Boeruine
^F02 
Archduke of Boeruine, a 12th-level Anuirean fighter
S:	17	AL:	LN
D:	15	AC:	-3
C:	15	hp:	100
I:	15	MV:	12
W:	13	THAC0:	9
Ch:	16	#AT:	3/2
		Dmg:	2d4+8
^F02 
Bloodline:	Anduiras, major, 60.
Blood Abilities:	Bloodmark (streak of red hair), battlewise, divine aura (major), Anduiras's resistance (great).
Equipment
The archduke typically carries Kingsbane, a bastard sword +4, and wears a suit of field plate mail +4.
^F02 
Description/History
Tough, middle-aged, Aeric Boeruine comes from a bloodline of power, but his cruelty and hostility have made his path to the Iron Throne rougher than he'd like.
^F02 
Raised as nobility, Boeruine never even questioned his right to power.  Instead, he has learned to rely on this right, and will fight to ensure that nobility remains nobility -- after all, a peasant can never learn the ways of the ruling class.  This attitude of the archduke's explains why the Chamberlain stands firmly opposed to his bid for the Throne.
^F02 
The archduke truly believes that laws provide the solution to all the Empire's problems -- and his laws would best suit Anuire, of course.  If needed, he will invade other realms to implement his laws, but he knows that he must tread carefully -- if enough regents oppose him, he'll evenutally lose his chance at the Iron Throne.

^F06Caliedhe Dosiere
^F02 
Imperial Chamberlain of Anuire, a 12th-/16th-level dual-class Anuirean fighter/diviner
S:	10	AL:	LG
D:	14	AC:	0
C:	13	hp:	67
I:	19	MV:	9
W:	17	THAC0:	9
Ch:	15	#AT:	1
		Dmg:	1d6
^F02 
Bloodline:	Anduiras, great, 64.
Blood Abilities:	Resistance (major), detect lie, divine aura (major), enhanced sense (major).
Equipment
Caliedhe Dosiere usually carries only a broadsword +4 called Thronegard and the signet ring bearing the Imperial Seal of Anuire.  On his right hand he wears a ring of office, which also acts as a ring of protection +4.  His wrists bear bracers of protection AC 4.
^F02 
Description/History
Caliedhe Dosiere, a middle-aged man of average build, has a fringe of dark hair outlining his head, accentuating his eagle-sharp eyes.  His mouth looks firm and strong, his hands capable and sure.  He is rarely seen without his ceremonial vestments, and he always wears the Imperial Seal of Anuire on a silver chain around his neck.  (He may not put on the signet ring, himself.) The quiet and polite Dosiere never raises his voice.  As the Chamberlain for a defunct Empire, he will continue to watch over the Irone Throne until a true king returns.  Adept with both the sword and the scrying pool, Dosiere uses both as the need arises.
^F02 
This man, who has tirelessly helped rebuild the land, rejects both Darien Avan and Aeric Boeruine, the two main contenders for the Throne.  He sees that the two concern themselves more with personal glory than the good of the Empire, so, instead of helping either one, the Chamberlain plays Boeruine and Avan off each other, hoping that some day a true king will arise from the scions of Anuire.
^F02 
The Chamberlain's enemies whisper that Caliedhe is none other than his purported ancestor, Traederic Dosiere, somehow granted immortality at the battle of Mount Deismaar.  For the last thousand years, they say, he makes a point of disappearing for a few months at a time, to return as his son, nephew, or some other relative.  This pattern has led the rulers of Anuire to believe that the Dosiere family remains always ready to produce a new Chamberlain, should the old one fall.
^F02 
Dosiere prefers that the nobles continue to place their faith in his family, and he entrusts the secret of his alleged longevity to only a few.  The Chamberlain claims publicly that he's descended from Traederic Dosiere and carries this ancestor's bloodline.  But immortal? Not by any stretch of the imagination.  Why, he asks suspicious nobles, would he not have aspired to the Iron Throne himself at least once if he truly could live forever? After all, who better than the Imperial Chamberlain to maneuver into that position of ultimate power?
^F02 
The Dosiere family is scattered about Anuire.  Some live in the hills of Dhoesone, others inhabit cottages near Diemed's ruins, while still more serve as Guardians of Mhoried.  All Dosieres study the ancient histories, record current Anuirean events, and stand ready to aid the Chamberlain, should he ask for help -- which he does, at times.  They share a proud legacy, whether or not the Chamberlain is immortal.
^F02

^F06Darien Avan
^F02 
Prince of Avanil, a 9th-level Anuirean fighter
S:	15	AL:	LN
D:	18	AC:	-3
C:	13	hp:	75
I:	16	MV:	12
W:	12	THAC0:	12
Ch:	17	#AT:	3/2
		Dmg:	1d8+6
^F02 
Bloodline:	Anduiras, great, 70.
Blood Abilities:	Animal affinity (major), bloodmark (dragon birthmark on face), persuasion (major), elemental control (great), regeneration (great).
Equipment
Avan favors fighting Brecht style, with two weapons and light armor.  His long sword +4 is called Scalebiter, and his short sword +3 is Heartseeker.  He wears a suit of elven chain +5.
^F02 
Description/History
Darien Avan, raised within sight of the City of Anuire, has believed all his life that he would one day reunite the shattered Empire.  His father sent him to study in Mhoried, where he became adept in swordplay; in Ghoere, where he mastered military strategy; and in Coeranys, where he learned to use politics to manipulate people.
^F02 
Now, in his middle years, Avan at last has his dream within sight.  Though he dares not take the City of Anuire by force, he already has some control over it.  His armies remain poised to attack Boeruine or defend against it, and nearly all the common folk support him; Avan courts them as shamelessly as their regents.

^F06Shaemes Lavalier
^F02 
7th-level Anuirean ranger
S:	18/54	AL:	CG
D:	16	AC:	4
C:	14	hp:	47
I:	13	MV:	24
W:	13	THAC0:	14 (7 with spear and Strength)
Ch:	9	#AT:	3/2
		Dmg:	1d6+8
^F02 
Bloodline:	Reynir, minor, 20.
Blood Abilities:	Animal affinity (major).
Equipment
Shaemes wears boots of speed and leather armor +2 -- but his most prized possession is his tighmaevril spear +5, named Heart Reaver.
^F02 
Description/History
Shaemes was born in Ghoere but reared in Mhoried, where he learned the ways of the forest.  A Guardian of the Mhor for a time, he decided to travel when his service ended.
^F02 
First he journeyed to Ghoere to visit his father.  While he was there, a petty noble and his retinue decided that the Lavalier farm had not paid enough taxes and determined to levy a tribute.  Giving him a spear handed down through generations, Shaemes's father told him to teach the baronet a lesson.
^F02 
The retainers were setting fire to the farm's outbuildings when Shaemes fought his way to the nobleman.  As he drove the spear through the baronet's heart, he saw the glowing life force flow from the dying man and into himself! The infusion of noble blood awakened a tainted bloodline in Shaemes -- he knew the spear was powerful beyond imagining.  Finding his father dead in the house, killed by the nobleman's rabble, he left the burning farm behind.  Now he travels Anuire, slaying other unfit regents.
^F02 
^F02 
^F06Teodor Profiev
^F02 
8th-level Vos paladin of Haelyn
S:	18/26	AL:	LG
D:	15	AC:	3
C:	15	hp:	62
I:	12	MV:	12
W:	14	THAC0:	13 (9 with Strength and sword)
Ch:	17	#AT:	3/2
		Dmg:	1d10+6
^F02 
Bloodline:	Azrai, major, 24.
Blood Abilities:	Alertness (minor), Azrai's resistance (major).
Equipment
Teodor carries a two-handed sword +3 he calls Awnshegh's Doom, wears a suit of scale mail +2, and has a short bow with 20 arrows +2.
^F02 
Description/History
The pale, black-haired Teodor Profiev is a true rarity among the Vos: a paladin of a god his people don't worship.  He has devoted his life to slaying awnsheghlien, and his travels have carried him across Cerilia to Anuire.
^F02 
Only Teodor knows his reasons for hunting awnsheghlien, and he's characteristically silent on the matter.  Perhaps he saw his family slaughtered by a traveling abomination, or perhaps he simply wants to express his hatred of his own bloodline of Azrai.  (Some call Profiev a direct descendant of the Raven.) Regardless, he always proves a terrible foe.
^F02 
The paladin is not fool enough to confront an awnshegh as powerful as the Spider or the Elf now, but he is building up his power.  One day, he'll seek awnsheghlien previously beyond his reach -- and woe to them then.
^F02 
^F02 
^F06Guilder Kalien
^F02 
5th-level half-elf thief from Brechtur
S:	13	AL:	NE
D:	18	AC:	1
C:	12	hp:	22
I:	16	MV:	12
W:	12	THAC0:	18
Ch:	16	#AT:	1
		Dmg:	1d6+4
^F02 
Bloodline:	Brenna, major, 30.
Blood Abilities:	Shadow-form (great).
Equipment
Guilder Kalien favors bracers of defense AC 4 and a short sword +4 that he calls the Diplomat.
^F02 
Description/History
Guilder Kalien was born somewhere in Brechtur -- he never says exactly where.  Kalien tends to discourage anyone from prying into his past too closely -- forcibly and permanently.  Most folks know he'd tired of life in the Brecht lands, but they aren't certain if he left of his own volition or someone else's.
^F02 
Kalien came to Endier about 30 years ago.  Soon after, the Baron of Endier suffered a small accident and adopted Kalien (who by now had taken the title "Guilder") as his prime lieutenant.  The baron's heirs began to die then, in appalling coincidence and despite Kalien's best efforts to protect them.  Finally, rule of the barony could fall to no one but Guilder Kalien.  The old baron died soon after, and Kalien began rebuilding Endier according to his plans.
^F02 
In the space of 20 years, the domain has become a traders' haven.  As a mercantile city, it soon will rival Ilien or the City of Anuire itself.  Most of the profit flows to Kalien's pockets, and he uses it to ensure his people's loyalty -- and to take good care of himself, too (evidenced by the precise coif of his dark hair and his selection of expensive hats).  As cunning as a serpent, the half-elf has a snakelike face to match.  One can't trust this blue-eyed merchant, and he can tell an enemy when he sees one.  He disposes of foes by any means handy.

^F06The Wizard
^F02 
10th-level human wizard of unknown heritage
S:	8	AL:	CE
D:	15	AC:	3
C:	13	hp:	22
I:	18	MV:	12
W:	12	THAC0:	11
Ch:	8	#AT:	1
		Dmg:	1d6+2
^F02 
Bloodline:	Vorynn, great, 45.
Blood Abilities:	Travel (great), alter features (major), enhanced senses (major).
Equipment
The Wizard carries a staff called Calamity.  It channels her magic, allows her to attack with a +2 bonus, and may have other abilities.  She wears bracers of defense AC 4.
^F02 
Description/History
No one knows much about the mysterious figure known as the Wizard.  She roams Anuire, wreaking havoc wherever she goes.  She taps into the ley lines of other mages, somehow casting realm spells without a known domain of her own.  She might have a secret source hidden in the wilds of Anuire, but few can guess where.  Folks know that she travels to random parts of Anuire for three months of the year, and her unpredictable appearance always seems to signal disasters and catastrophes.
^F02 
The Wizard's great love of destruction prompts her to incredible heights of chaotic behavior.  This mysterious blond woman seems ageless -- some say she has had a hand in the downfall of several realms throughout history.  Many speculate that the Wizard is actually the Eyeless One of the Five Peaks, but they can show no proof.  Though the two seem to share certain traits, the Eyeless One's domain continues to function even while the Wizard travels.
^F02

^F06Tie'skar Graecher
^F02 
King of Thurazor, a 7th-level goblin fighter
S:	15	AL:	LE
D:	10	AC:	3
C:	14	hp:	43
I:	15	MV:	9
W:	9	THAC0:	14
Ch:	12	#AT:	2
		Dmg:	1d6+2/1d6+2
^F02 
Bloodline:	Azrai, major, 22.
Blood Abilities:	Poison sense, fear.
Equipment
Tie'skar shows an absurd attachment to his old glaive, a rusty short sword +2 he calls Fleshrender.
^F02 
Description/History
The King of Thurazor is far more crafty than he lets on.  Though Graecher is getting on in years, none of his faculties have dimmed, and he seems always ready to face another challenger to his throne.  For this reason, he cultivates the aspect of a senile old king, hoping to lure the more foolish of his subjects into actions they will regret later.
^F02 
Tie'skar Graecher rose up from the lowest ranks of goblin nobility using the cunning and brutality that would mark his later reign.  He murdered several of his rivals, arranged accidents for others, and eventually poisoned the old king before that crafty old goblin could become wary of the danger Graecher presented.  The old king's heirs met with similar deaths, which continued until all the goblin nobles were afraid to take up the crown, and Graecher could assume it with impunity.  Though no one could prove he had murdered his way to the top, all certainly suspected it -- and accorded him the respect due to a true king.

^F06Nadia Vasily
^F02 
8th-level Vos priestess of Kriesha
S:	14	AL:	LE
D:	14	AC:	3
C:	12	hp:	43
I:	14	MV:	9
W:	16	THACO:	16
Ch:	16	#AT:	1
		Dmg:	1d6+4
^F02 
Bloodline:	Azrai, major, 31.
Blood Abilities:	Azrai's travel (great).
Equipment
Nadia wears chain mail +2 and carries a mace +3 that harbors strange powers.
^F02 
Description/History
The beautiful Nadia Vasily always dresses entirely in white and black, which sets off her raven hair and her snow-pale skin.  She travels through Anuire seeking something, leaving cold death in her wake when she can not find what she needs.
^F02 
It is said that Nadia seeks to kill Teodor Profiev.  The tales told in the taverns of the North say that he spurned her suit and rejected Kriesha, her goddess, to follow Haelyn, and that she now hunts him to make him pay for this slight.  It is also told that she was sent by the awnshegh Raven to rein in this destructive "son of Azrai," to bring him back that he might become the Raven's second-in-command and realize his full nature.
^F02 
Men can not seem to resist her lures, though she is plainly uninterested in them.  All of them seem to think that they will be the ones to tame her and bring her under control; their corpses are usually found with blue lips and horror etched on their frosted features.
^F02 
Nadia is cold and unfriendly, and even her words seem to carry a blast of arctic air.  She tends to avoid populated areas, and so her fame remains chiefly in rural areas.
^F02

^F06Kalilah bint Daouta
^F02 
5th-level Khinasi paladin of Avani
S:	14	AL:	LN
D:	15	AC:	4
C:	15	hp:	35
I:	13	MV:	12
W:	16	THACO:	16
Ch:	18	#AT:	1
		Dmg:	1d8
^F02 
Bloodline:	Basaia, major, 37.
Blood Abilities:	Enhanced senses (major), animal affinity (major).
Equipment
Kalilah carries no equipment out of the ordinary -- she's determined either to make or find her own, rather than having it gifted to her.
^F02 
Description/History
Kalilah is the third daughter of the Patriarch of Elinie.  She is stunningly beautiful, a fact she relishes and uses to its best advantage.  She has no trouble convincing her enemies that this means she's harmless -- until she turns the tables on them unexpectedly.
^F02 
As the daughter of the patriarch, she feels it is her responsibility to show her father that she is fit for the throne, and she knows exactly what she can do to earn it.  Thus, she has made it her mission to track down the Wizard and bring the evil mage to justice.  She is not quite single-minded in this pursuit, but she dislikes having to turn aside from it.  Still, she will aid those in need, and she has already enhanced her bloodline strength by slaying a few wayward lesser awnsheghlien.
^F02 
She is only rarely to be found in Elinie -- her quest for the Wizard has led her all over Anuire, and she's still far behind her target.  She can be encountered almost anywhere there's a mage abusing magic -- and she has declared her intention to pay a visit to the mysterious Eyeless One.
^F02 
^F02 
^F06Grimm Graybeard
^F02 
Overthane of Baruk-Azhik, a 7th-/8th-level dwarf fighter/priest of Moradin
S:	18/96	AL: 	LG
D: 	10	AC: 	0
C: 	18	hp: 	47
I:	14	MV: 	6
W:	17	THACO: 	14
Ch: 	14	#AT: 	3/2
		Dmg: 	1d10+5
^F02 
Bloodline:	Anduiras, major, 38.
Blood Abilities:	Battlewise (major), courage (great).
Equipment
Grimm's most valued possession is his two-handed battle axe +3 called Orogbane.  Against a blooded orog, it acts like a tighmaevril weapon.
^F02 
Description/History
Unlike most Cerilian dwarves, Grimm Graybeard wears his beard long.  He's also unusual in his dour mien, suggestive of untold tragedy.
^F02 
The dwarf's visage hides a belief he'll never share: His realm is doomed.  He alone knows the true might of the orogs contained under the Iron Peaks, and he fears desperately for his people.  Graybeard feels he'll be the last dwarf regent of Baruk-Azhik.
^F02 
Nonetheless, he's still a dwarf and, therefore, remains relatively undaunted by the task ahead of him.  If destroying the orogs requires the death of every dwarf in Baruk-Azhik, Grimm Graybeard knows that his people would willingly pay that price.  Unfortunately, he feels fairly certain that the annihilation of the Iron Peaks orogs would take more than just the strength of his people alone.

^F07B^F06ackground of the Anuire World
^F02 
^F06Introduction to Background
^F02 
Dark storm clouds gather over war-torn lands.  Armies march wearily into battle once again, answering the ancient call to arms.  The banners of noble houses flutter raggedly before the onslaught; some will fall, never to rise again, while others will weather the storm.  Across the ruined empires of Cerilia, the dogs of war are let loose one more time.  Somewhere on a muddy battlefield, a common man becomes a hero -- and a hero becomes a king.
^F02 
The Birthright campaign world is like no other AD&D game world ever developed.  In this setting, player characters are kings and nobles, prelates and guildmasters, great wizards and master thieves.  They're the leaders of their own kingdoms and domains, wielding the power to wage war or preserve peace.  At their commands, armies march and kingdoms fall.
^F02 
^F05The Legacy of Kings
^F02 
Characters in the Birthright game world enjoy the chance to be descendants of heroes of old.  Such ancient heritages are called bloodlines.  Scions of these bloodlines are gifted with abilities beyond those of common folk, and over hundreds of years, they've naturally risen to positions of power.  Some intangible quality of royalty -- an aura or divine right -- calls to the ancient blood; as a result, most of Cerilia's rulers are descendants of the blood.
^F02 
Bloodlines wax and wane in strength with the quality of a king's rule.  Hundreds of bloodlines have been extinguished since the devastating wars that shaped modern Cerilia, while others have risen in prominence and power.
^F02 
Bloodlines of both evil and good exist.  The most extreme are those descended from the forces of darkness that besieged the land in the dawn of history.  These powerful creatures are known as the awnsheghlien (awn-SHAY-lin), an elvish word meaning "blood of darkness."
^F02 
^F05Blood and Domains
^F02 
For easy reference, the most important terms used in this game system are described below:
^F02 
^F11Bloodline Definition
^F02 
Bloodlines were created when the heroes at the battle of Mount Deismaar were imbued with the essence of the gods.  A character's bloodline is his heritage of divine power.  Bloodlines are described in two ways:  through their strength and derivation.  Many characters also command unique blood abilities--supernatural powers granted only to scions of the ancient lines.
^F02 
^F11Domain Definition
^F02 
A domain is an entity controlled by a character; it may be a kingdom, guild, temple, or magical dominion.  Any scion who rules a domain is known as a regent; he accumulates Regency Points (RP) based on the strength of his domain and the success of his rule.
^F02 
Domains may comprise any combination of provinces (physical territories) or the various types of holdings found within provinces.
^F02 
^F11Domain Turn Definition
^F02 
The domain turn equals three months of game time; it is divided into three action rounds, each equal to one month.  During the domain turn, regents collect taxes, raise armies, and engage in political or military endeavors to lead their domains to prosperity and power.
^F02 
^F11Regency Definition
^F02 
Regency is the aura of command and presence that surrounds the blooded rulers of domains.  It is measured in game terms by the Regency Point score.

^F02 
^F05Dwarves-More Info
^F02 
Dwarves lived in the mountains of Cerilia untold years before humans came to the land.  Over time, the dwarven holds elected a defensive strategy, fortifying their approaches and retreating to their cities under the mountains when threatened.  Dwarves have a fierce hatred of orogs as a result of uncounted wars fought in the deeps under the earth.
^F02 
The typical dwarf stands 4 to 4.5 feet in height and has an exceptionally stocky build and thick, sturdy bones.  Dwarves are creatures who derive from stone -- they are true children of the mountains -- and their bodies are twice as dense as other creatures.  As a result, dwarves weigh as much as 250 to 300 pounds.
^F02 
A dwarf's skin is gray, stony, and cold to the touch.  All dwarves have eyes that are dark as jet, and their hair and beards are black or dark gray and are normally cropped short.
^F02 
With regard to other races, Cerilian dwarves usually adhere to a friendly neutrality; thus, they are on good terms with most other races, including the elves.  They're masterful craftsmen and traders; dwarven caravans roam from Anuire to Vos laden with their goods.  Dwarven arms and armor are the best in Cerilia, and it is not uncommon to see dwarves selling their services as mercenaries.
^F02 
Like standard AD&D dwarves, Cerilian dwarves are nonmagical and never use wizard magic.  They gain the standard saving throw modifiers allowed to dwarves against magic and poison, and suffer the standard 20% chance for magic malfunction.  Since they're accustomed to underground surroundings, they have the normal mining detection abilities, and Cerilian dwarves have infravision with a range of 90 feet.
^F02 
Dwarves gain no bonuses to attack rolls against specific monsters and have no special skill at fighting giants, but orogs and ogres subtract 2 from attack rolls against a Cerilian dwarf.  A dwarf's dense body suffers only half damage from bludgeoning or crushing attacks.  Dwarves can carry amazing burdens, and for purposes of encumbrance, a dwarf's strength is considered four points higher than his actual score.  (Each percentage bracket from 18/01 to 18/00 counts as one point.)
^F02 
^F01SEE DWARVES FOR MORE INFORMATION.
^F02 
^F05Elves-More Info
^F02 
The elves of Cerilia are a graceful but reclusive race, suspicious of humankind.  Early in Cerilia's history, the elves contested human settlement of the continent's vast forests, and a strong current of ill will toward the human nations still runs strong in the elven woods.
^F02 
There is only one race of Cerilian elves; they call themselves the Sidhelien (SHEE-lin).  The Sidhelien hold court in deep, mist-wreathed vales in the darkest hearts of the ancient Cerilian forests.
^F02 
Elves stand as tall as humans, but are far more slender and graceful.  Most average 5.5 to 6 feet in height, but weigh only 120 to 140 pounds.  All have fair skin and dark hair, and their features are exquisitely fine.  Elves possess an unearthly beauty, and their perfect voices can hold a mortal spellbound.  Unfortunately, elves are too mindful of their superiority and treat outsiders with coldness or condescension.
^F02 
Cerilian elves are creatures of faerie dust and starlight, gifted with immortality and powers of mind and body beyond those of humankind.  They are a force for neither good nor evil; an elven wood can be perilous for human travelers, but even more so for goblins or gnolls.
^F02 
The elven heart is unfathomable to nonelves; they're moved to wild delight, dark melancholy, or burning rage with only the slightest cause.  More than anything else, elves are unpredictable, doing what pleases them from one moment to the next.
^F02 
Like normal AD&D elves, they resist sleep and charm spells (90% resistance).  They are unaffected by aging attacks and normal disease (only magical diseases such as lycanthropy or mummy rot can harm them).  Cerilian elves have no infravision or ability to see in total darkness, but can see by starlight or moonlight as well as a human sees by daylight.  Elves don't need sleep, but they can become physically exhausted and must rest quietly, studying spells or standing watch, for about as long as a human needs to sleep.
^F02 
Cerilian elves have no special attack bonuses and no ability to detect secret doors or concealed objects, but they are able to surprise opponents when alone.  Elves in Cerilia pass without trace in natural settings and ignore ground characteristics when moving or marching; an elf can travel over heavy snow, soft sand, or a treacherous mountainside as easily as a human walks across a smooth wooden floor.
^F02 
Cerilian elves follow any nonlawful alignment; it's not in their natures to place the values of society above the freedom of the individual.
^F02 
^F01SEE ELVES FOR MORE INFORMATION.
^F02 
^F05Half-elves More Info
^F02 
From time to time, a particularly handsome or beautiful human with courage and a gracious manner may walk among the Sidhelien unscathed.  A few humans have even been accepted as equals in the elven courts.  Mortals (by elven standards) quickly become lost in the elven spell; the years reel by in splendor and celebration, while the world outside comes to a halt or leaps centuries ahead.  Such a mortal may return home to find that only a single night has passed, or that a hundred years have flown by.  More often than not, a mortal's life runs out in a heartbeat.
^F02 
Half-elves are the rare children of these unusual men and women and their elf partners.  The elves regard such offspring as Sidhelien and welcome them fully in elf society.  Humans, however, tend to be suspicious of half-elves, referring to them as bewitched or as changelings; it is rare for half-elves to leave the elven woods.
^F02 
Like their elven parents, half-elves are beautiful and graceful, but their builds are heavier -- they fall within the human ranges for height and weight.  Half-elves have 30% resistance to sleep and charm spells and effects, and 30% resistance to disease and aging attacks.  They share their elven parent's night vision, but must sleep as much as a normal human.

^F05Humans-More Info
^F02 
Humans are the most populous race in Cerilia and inhabit every part of the continent.  Five human nationalities or cultures currently exist: the Anuireans, the Khinasi, the Brechts, the Rjurik, and the Vos.  Human characters are probably of Anuirean descent, especially if they are regents; obviously, Anuireans rule the Anuirean lands.  Characters who are not regents, on the other hand, may have wandered to Anuire from any corner of Cerilia.
^F02 
Anuireans are native to the southwestern portion of Cerilia.  The ancient Anuireans were a fair-skinned, red-haired people, but over centuries of extensive contact with other cultures, Anuireans have lost most defining physical characteristics.
^F02 
Anuirean society is semifeudal and based on a class of free farmers and craftsmen.  Regents (rulers of domains) are usually titled nobles.  Anuireans respect nobility and look to their leaders to protect them from the barbarians and savages who surround the states of the old Empire.  Commoners identify strongly with their lords, and the dealings and alliances of the noble families are topics of continuous discussion throughout Anuirean lands.
^F02 
The Brechts inhabit north-central Cerilia.  They tend to be short and stocky, with dark hair and eyes.  Early in their history, they were under the rule of Anuirean governors, and Brecht nobility declined drastically in power and importance.  When the Anuirean Empire fell and the Brechts gained independence, the guilds and merchants came into power.  The nobility is weak in Brechtur, and several states have declared themselves republics.
^F02 
The Brechts believe in free enterprise, and Brecht society revolves around wealth.  The Brechts have a fierce love of independence and a tradition of self-reliance; they don't wait for their lords or rulers to solve problems for them.  Commerce and trade are expressions of this belief, and Brecht commoners owe their first loyalty to guilds and companies.
^F02 
Khinasi characters are native to the region known as Khinasi.  They're descended from the Basarji, and speak the language of the same name.  The Basarji arrived in Cerilia from lands across the Sea of Dragons.  They are tall and lanky, with aquiline features and dark eyes.  Their complexions range from a light coffee to a dark brown color.
^F02 
Unlike the other human cultures, the Khinasi have no fear of magic.  The study of magic is considered the noblest of callings, and the Khinasi universities devoted to magic are the finest in Cerilia.  Like the Brechts, Khinasi commoners are traders and merchants, but an individual's decorum, hospitality, and conduct are far more important than gross wealth.
^F02 
The Rjurik inhabit the taiga forests and highlands of northwestern Cerilia.  They are a tall, broad-shouldered people with blond or red hair and fair complexions.  Men and women most commonly wear their hair in long braids.
^F02 
The Rjurik are stubborn individualists who don't swear fealty to anyone but their own kin; the family is the most important part of Rjurik life.
^F02 
Most Rjurik follow the god Erik, a druidical power, and druids are revered throughout Rjurik society as teachers, leaders, and advisers.  All Rjurik have a deep respect and love for Cerilia's wilds, and carefully avoid over-hunting or clearing virgin forest.
^F02 
The Vos are a barbaric race from the cold mountains and forests of northeastern Cerilia.  They are tall, thick-boned people with flat features, light eyes, and sallow skin.  Male warriors are fond of shaving their heads and wearing long, drooping mustaches.
^F02 
The Vos have a rigid code of face and honor that demands blood for even unintentional insults.  Their leaders are war-chieftains known as tsarevos who are advised by the priests of the grim Vos gods.  Almost all Vos men are warriors and hunters -- other professions are considered unmanly.  Vos women are by custom greatly limited in their freedoms, although a few women have succeeded as warriors or tsarevas.

^F05Character Class
^F02 
The classes for a Birthright campaign are generally the same as those in AD&D, but some special notes and abilities are added for Cerilian characters.  In particular, wizards operate differently in a Birthright campaign.
^F02 
^F11Fighter
^F02 
Of all the regents in Cerilia, fighter regents outnumber regents of all other classes.  Blooded fighters often set out to expand their kingdoms by sheer force.
^F02 
^F11Paladin
^F02 
In Cerilia, paladins are found only among the Anuireans and the Khinasi; only characters of these two nationalities may choose this class.  Anuirean paladins choose to serve Haelyn, Cuiraecen, or Nesirie.  Khinasi paladins follow either Halaia (Haelyn) or Avani.  The paladin's choice of patron affects his particular attitudes, spell selections, and powers.
^F02 
^F11Ranger
^F02 
Cerilian rangers follow all rules for rangers in AD&D.
^F02 
^F11Priest
^F02 
Every priest character in a Birthright campaign must choose one of the Cerilian powers and abide by the allowed weapons, armor, and spheres of access granted to priests of that deity.  In some cases, these restrictions are similar to the standard abilities associated with the cleric class, but in other cases, priests may command unusual abilities.  Refer to the Gods of Cerilia section in Part III for descriptions of the deities.
^F02 
Priest characters who choose to be regents should select from the powers venerated in Anuire.  (Nonregent priests can originate anywhere.) Halfling priests worship an aspect of Avanalae; the dwarves follow the god Moradin.  The Sidhelien have no deities at all (thus, Cerilian elves cannot be priests).
^F02 
^F11Wizard
^F02 
The lands of Cerilia are inherently magical, and a mage with both the right and the knowledge can create wonders and terrors with the power the land provides.  But true mages and high sorcery are quite rare in the Birthright campaign, and every sorcerer is a figure of mystery and destiny.  In all of Cerilia, there are no more than six or seven score true mages; less than half that number are regents capable of wielding realm magic.
^F02 
Cerilian mages recognize three orders of magic: lesser magic, true magic, and realm magic.  Any person of sufficient intelligence and training can command lesser magic, comprising the arts of illusion and divination.  These two schools draw upon energies that are drastically different and relatively weaker than the energies used by the other schools of magic.  Lesser magic also includes the 1st- and 2nd-level spells of the other schools.
^F02 
True magic includes all other schools of wizardry, but only elves, half-elves, and blooded humans can command its arcane power.  Wizards must be born with the stuff of magic in their veins to wield spells of 3rd level or higher from all schools of magic.
^F02 
The most powerful enchantments are known as realm magic; they are woven from the power of the land itself.  Only wizards who are regents may use these spells; a wizard without the energy provided by a sorcerous domain would be destroyed utterly if such a spell were attempted.
^F02 
Any wizard who is capable of casting realm magic can also wield true magic and lesser magic.  Wielders of true magic can also use lesser magic.
^F02 
^F11Thief
^F02 
All common and blooded thieves operate as described for their character class in AD&D.
^F02 
If the regent is a merchant prince (as opposed to an underworld figure), these thugs are employees, craftsmen, or workers who can be diverted from other tasks.
^F02 
As long as a thief regent maintains a holding in a province, he can evade arrest indefinitely.  However, if his holding is reduced to level 0 or divested, his immunity vanishes.
^F02 
^F11Bard
^F02 
In Cerilia, bards are revered as historians, heralds, messengers, and advisers.  Their neutrality is respected by all but the most barbaric human lands (although the elven forests and the lands dominated by awnsheghlien pose danger even to bards).  The skill and wisdom of a court bard is often a great status symbol for a ruler.
^F02 
Most bards belong to a college, which is a loose association rather than a place of learning.  Each college has its own goals and hidden agendas.  Bad blood exists between some colleges, but most have a friendly or tolerant attitude toward the others.  A bard's college provides a network of correspondents, observers, and allies who look after his interests in their own areas -- and who expect him to do likewise for them.
^F02 
The first Cerilian bards are said to have been wandering elves, who were sent into the human lands by open-minded elven kings to teach and learn from their human neighbors.  Each of these elves founded a bardic college; today, human students continue the work of their elven mentors.
^F02 
^F05Languages
^F02 
The five human tongues serve as localized forms of common in each respective area of Cerilia.  Some of these languages have ancient or archaic forms which scholars study in order to read ancient writings.  Elvish is the oldest language of Cerilia, and has remained remarkably unchanged in thousands of years.
^F02

^F02 
^F05Equipment
^F02 
In general, all of the weapons, armor, and equipment in AD&D are available in Cerilia.  However, not all equipment is available everywhere.  For example, only the Khinasi show a preference for curved swords, so scimitars are typically sold only in Khinasi cities.
^F02 
Tables 7 and 8 list the availability of arms, armor, and mounts in each Cerilian culture.  If a desired item isn't available in a character's region, the player character must travel to that locale, or locate an importer or trader who deals in the item and pay a premium (an extra 10-50%) for it.  Weapons and armor that are not listed are commonly available everywhere.
^F02 
The abbreviations are Anuire (An), Brechtur (Br), Khinasi (Kh), Rjurik (Rj), Vosgaard (Vs).

^F02 
^F11Crossbow
^F02 
In the Birthright campaign, crossbows have exceptional penetrating power and thus a special advantage against armor.  At medium range, an armored target is treated as if his AC were two points worse than his actual armor class (crossbows gain no advantage against unarmored targets).  At short range, an armored target is treated as if his AC were five points worse than his actual armor class.  For example, a knight in full plate mail is AC 1, but a crossbow fired at short range is rolled as if the target were AC 6.  A wizard wearing bracers of defense AC 4 is treated as AC 4 against the same shot.
^F02 
Rules for range and ROF are as detailed in AD&D.
^F02 
^F11Main-gauche
^F02 
This parrying dagger provides an AC bonus of +1 when wielded by a proficient user.  It cannot be used to attack in the same round in which it is used for defense.  If the weapon is used for an attack rather than for defense, the AC bonus is forfeited.
^F02 
^F11Claymore
^F02 
The claymore was developed by the Rjurik to attack the heavy armor worn by Anuirean knights.  It is a well-balanced, two-handed sword of medium length.
^F02 
^F11Cutlass
^F02 
Popular among seafarers, the cutlass is a heavy, slightly curved, single-edged blade with a basket hilt.
^F02 
^F11Rapier
^F02 
Rapiers are common in regions where heavy armor is not conventional.  They're especially popular in Brechtur.
^F02 
^F11Sabre
^F02 
Khinasi cavalrymen favor the sabre.  Its slightly curved, heavy blade puts more weight behind the swing than the lighter blade of a scimitar.

^F11Breastplate and Leather (AC 6, 25 lbs.)
^F02 
Anuirean infantry and pikemen are often equipped with a breastplate that is worn over a long, leather coat.  The steel plate protects the wearer's vitals; leather sleeves and leggings provide a small degree of protection for the limbs.  The entire ensemble costs 80 gp.
^F02 
^F11Half plate (AC 4, 40 lbs.)
^F02 
Elite foot troops and most medium and heavy cavalry wear half-plate armor, which consists of plate protection for the torso, thighs, and lower arms.  Whereas plate mail comprises plates that are worn over chain mail, half plate comprises plates worn over soft leather.  Half plate costs 300 gp.
^F02 
^F11Improved mail (AC 4, 50 lbs.)
^F02 
The Khinasi dislike plate armor, but increasing improvements in Vos and Anuirean armor have forced the Khinasi to improve their chain mail by reinforcing it with small metal bars threaded through the links.  The Rjurik version of improved mail doubles the thickness of normal chain.  Either version costs 180 gp.
^F02 
^F11Varsk
^F02 
The cold wilderness of Vosgaard is home to the varsks, a variety of white-furred giant lizard domesticated by the Vos.  The weather and poor forage of lands make it difficult for the Vos to keep horses, but varsks are adapted to cold weather and can go for as long as two weeks with minimal food.
^F02 
A varsk costs about 250 gp, although an outstanding animal might fetch twice that price.  They are normally available only in Vosgaard, since they don't fare well in warmer climates and don't get along with horses or other domesticated animals.
^F02 
They can carry riders and loads of up to 240 pounds without being slowed; up to 360 pounds for one-half speed; and up to 480 pounds for one-third speed.  They're well-adapted to moving over snow and ice, and ignore movement penalties in such terrain.
^F02 
^F11New Weapons and Armor
^F02 
Some weapons and armor have characteristics unique to Cerilia; for example, Cerilian crossbows are far more powerful and have better damage ratings than their counterparts listed in AD&D.  Special characteristics for such equipment are listed in the following section.
^F02 
^F11Table 9:	Statistics for Cerilian Weapons
^F02

* Assumes a bolt of appropriate size for the weapon; statistics should be adjusted if other bolt is used.
^F02 
^F11Other Equipment
^F02 
Adventurers depend on all kinds of equipment, rations, and devices of convenience and necessity.  The equipment lists in AD&D are generally applicable in Cerilia.  If a question arises about the kinds of technology available, use the following approximations.
^F02 
Anuireans, Brechts, Khinasi, elves, and dwarves are the equivalent of Renaissance culture. 
The Rjurik and orogs are the equivalent of Middle Ages culture.
The Vos, goblins, and gnolls approximate Dark Ages technology.
^F02 
^F05Bloodlines
^F02 
All characters begin play as either commoners or as scions of the ancient bloodlines.  Only blooded characters can be regents and thus rule their own domains, but hundreds of blooded characters also exist who don't rule kingdoms.  These scions may be cousins of a regent, second or third heirs, or other relations who aren't in line for the crown.
^F02 
Characters who have common origins aren't automatically peasants just because they do not descend from an ancient bloodline.  They can come from any level of society.  In fact, great numbers of high-born nobles, courtiers, advisers, and government officials come from mundane heritages.  There are two good reasons to play a common character: first, the character avoids the responsibilities of ruling a kingdom; second, role-playing a squire, adviser, wizard, or captain in the service of another player character can be fun.
^F02 
^F11Bloodline Strength
^F02 
The blood of an ancient hero may run undiluted in a character's veins, or he may have only the most tenuous claim to a bloodline.  This is identified by his bloodline strength.  Over time, the character's bloodline may grow stronger through wise rule as a regent or by confronting the scions of other bloodlines and defeating them in heroic combat.
^F02 
Similarly, a blooded character who is defeated by another scion loses some of his bloodline strength.  Most regents and scions are cautious of possible encounters with others of their kind, since scions have been known to kill each other for the power of their blood.  The creatures known as the awnsheghlien do so without hesitation; the most famous example was the death of Michael Roele, the Emperor of Anuire, at the hands of the Gorgon.
^F02 
Tainted bloodlines are either diluted by commoners in the family tree or were never strong lines from the beginning.  Only a vestige of the divine right remains, and after another generation or two, the line may evaporate completely.  However, tainted bloodlines have returned to prominence through the actions of exceptional characters.
^F02 
Minor bloodlines are usually descended from nonheroic figures who were present at Deismaar.  Thousands of common footsoldiers and camp followers survived the battle to perpetuate minor bloodlines.  Many of these minor lines were destroyed, however, in the chaos of the first two centuries that followed Deismaar.
^F02 
Major bloodlines represent lines descended from the heroes of Deismaar and the most powerful minor characters who survived the first decades of bloodtheft.  Almost all of the major bloodlines are famous throughout Cerilia, and the deeds and feuds of their heirs are the stuff of story and legend.
^F02 
Great bloodlines are exceedingly rare.  Only the greatest heroes of Deismaar were worthy of bloodlines of such strength, and even then, only if they happened to be close to one of the deities.  In the Anuirean region, the lines of Boeruine and Avan are great lines.  El-Arrasi's bloodline is a great line in Khinasi.
^F02 
True bloodlines originate from only one source: the chosen champion of one of the gods of Deismaar.  The champion must still be alive, or must have passed the bloodline to his direct descendants.  The Gorgon is an example; he was present at Deismaar as the champion of Azrai and still lives today.  If the bloodline of Roele had survived, it would be a true line today.  Player characters may not start out as descendants of true bloodlines (but could possibly discover such a heritage later).
^F02 
^F11Derivations of Power
^F02 
Bloodlines are indications of more than sheer power.  The nature of the divine essence pervading a character's heritage is just as important as its strength.  The derivation of the bloodline represents which of the ancient deities the character's power stems from.  When the gods of the Andu, the Rjuven, the Brechts, the Basarji, and even the Masetians faced Azrai at the battle of Mount Deismaar, they gave up their own immortal lives in order to stop their evil brother.  The mortals who survived absorbed the essences of these individual deities.
^F02 
Although most of the ancient deities were closely tied to their tribes, the cataclysm of Mount Deismaar didn't respect nationality or race.  The bloodlines of the elder gods were distributed almost randomly among the survivors.  There is a slight tendency for bloodlines of an old god to be more prevalent among members of its tribe, since the old gods tended to perish in the vicinity of their own followers.  For example, the line of Anduiras is the most common in the Anuirean lands.
^F02 
Six derivations, or foundations for bloodlines (plus a seventh that no one cares to speak of) are recognized: the lines of Anduiras, Reynir, Brenna, Basaia, Masela, Vorynn, and the cursed taint of Azrai.  Most people infected by Azrai's blood have become awnsheghlien.
^F02 
^F05The Bloodlines
^F02 
No one has ever accurately counted the number of bloodlines that exist in Cerilia, but each derivation runs in two or three to as many as several dozen families.  All members of a family share the same bloodline derivation and strength.
^F02 
Every bloodline runs in a different line of descent from a different individual affected by the events at Mount Deismaar.  A bloodline refers only to a specific family line and has no connection with equivalent bloodlines possessed by unrelated characters.
^F02 
An important thing to remember about bloodlines is this: Regency doesn't always follow direct lines of descent.  From time to time, exceptional commoners have become blooded simply by being in the right place at the right time when a king or other ruler died.  Some of the explanations for these occurrences remain a mystery, but history records several such incidents.  A person's heirs are not always his children; in most cases, heirs are actively chosen and not left to chance.
^F02 
^F11Blood Abilities
^F02 
Scions of the ancient lines usually possess unusual talents or powers associated with their derivations.  These special powers are known as blood abilities.  
^F02 
If a character's bloodline increases in strength, he very well may gain new blood abilities or increase the power of a current one. If a character's bloodline drops to a lower category, he loses abilities.
^F02 
Blood abilities are generally designed to be role-playing tools and magical advantages for blooded characters to reflect their unique heritages. Abilities that duplicate spell effects do not require material components.
^F02 
Some of the abilities listed in Table 13 are major or great abilities only; certain others may not be allowed to all derivations.
^F02

^F02 
^F11Battlewise
^F02Major
Derivations: Anduiras, Azrai
The scion with this ability is a military genius, blessed with an uncanny power to analyze enemy weaknesses, create sound plans of attack, and inspire troops to victory.  Any army he leads is far more effective than a similar force under another commander.  The scion adds one point to the attack and defense ratings of any army he commands personally -- he must be present at the battle to gain this advantage.
^F02 
If two armies face each other and both leaders have this ability, all bonuses cancel.
^F02 
^F11Bloodmark
^F02Minor
Derivation:  Any
The blooded character bears a visible, recognizable sign of his special heritage.  Depending on the family, it may be a white streak in the hair, eyes of brilliant green, or a birthmark.  NPCs who recognize the mark will tend to be respectful toward the scion, and even enemies perceive the mark as a warning to conduct themselves carefully around the scion.  The bloodmark's effect is a bonus to encounter reaction checks, depending on the circumstances of the meeting.
^F02 
^F11Courage
^F02Minor, Major, Great
Derivation:  Anduiras
As the ancient god of noble battle, Anduiras imbued supernatural courage into many of the bloodlines derived from him.  As a minor ability, characters with courage automatically succeed saving throws versus spells and effects that create magical or normal fear, including cause fear, scare, spook, emotion, fear, phantasmal killer, drums of panic, dragon fear, and similar effects.  For effects that are normally allowed no save, the character may roll a saving throw with a -2 penalty.
^F02 
As a major ability, this effect extends to all allies within 10 feet.  As a great ability, all units in the scion's area of the battlefield automatically succeed morale checks.
^F02 
^F11Detect Illusion
^F02Minor
Derivation:  Any except Anduiras
Scions with this ability are rarely fooled by illusion spells that create false visual images.  When a scion encounters an illusion, he is immediately allowed a saving throw versus spell.  Success means the scion instantly perceives the illusion for what it is, even if he is making no particular effort to disbelieve the illusion
^F02 
This ability is effective against any illusion spell that creates a false image or substitutes a false image for reality.  The scion gains no advantage against spells such as invisibility, deafness, blur, fear, and eyebite.
^F02 
^F11Divine Aura
^F02Major, Great
Derivations:  All except Brenna
An intangible mantle of power and nobility surrounds some blooded characters, commanding respect from all they meet.  Divine aura marks the character as a scion of power, just as a bloodmark does; the character gains a bonus to all encounter reaction checks and diplomacy actions.
^F02 
^F11Divine Wrath
^F02Major
Derivations:  Anduiras, Basaia, Masela
When a character with this ability is moved to great anger, he becomes a terrible enemy.  His body is imbued with extreme strength, and the mere sight of his angry visage terrifies his enemies.  The divine wrath can never be summoned voluntarily; it comes over the scion only when he battles someone who has wronged his loved ones or himself.
^F02 
This condition grants the character the following: a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
^F02 
Furthermore, any enemy within 10 feet of the character who meets his gaze must save versus spell or be stricken with fear and flee.
^F02 
^F11Enhanced Sense
^F02Minor, Major
Derivations:  All
Blooded characters are sometimes gifted with powers of perception far beyond those of ordinary mortals.  The nature of the enhanced sense depends on the derivation and power of the character's bloodline.
^F02 
^F10Anduiras
^F02Scions of Anduiras may detect evil three times per day, as described for paladins in AD&D.
^F10Azrai
^F02A scion of Azrai can see into and through shadows without difficulty.  At dusk, his vision is as acute as if it were bright daylight. The effects of darkness are reduced by 50%.
^F02 
^F10Brenna
^F02Brenna's line is blessed with the sight and hearing of cats; thus they are endowed with infravision.
^F02 
^F10Vorynn
^F02Characters of Vorynn's line have a limited ability to see into the future. By concentrating, the scion may attempt to learn the result of his actions, thereby being able to modify and improve his plans. This effectively raises his ability to manage his realm.
^F02 
^F11Fear
^F02Major
Derivation:  Azrai
With a touch, the scion can instill absolute terror in his victim, as per the fear spell cast by a 10th-level wizard.  Armor doesn't hamper the effect; the character need only brush his victim lightly (although an attack roll may be required depending on circumstances).  The scion can use this power three times per day.  As an incidental benefit, the scion gains a +2 bonus to his saving throws versus all types of fear that allow saves.
^F02 
^F11Healing
^F02Minor, Major, Great
Derivation: Anduiras, Basaia, Reynir
The ancient powers were capable of miraculous feats of healing; some blooded characters have inherited these powers. A character gifted with healing as a minor ability can restore a character's health once per adventure. With the major ability, a healer can restore a character's health twice per adventure. A healer with the great ability may restore a character's health thrice per adventure. 
^F02 
^F11Heightened Ability
^F02Minor
Derivation: All except Masela
The old powers each cherished different traits in their followers and embodied these characteristics.  The resulting bloodlines often show near-divine examples of strength, intelligence, or beauty.  A scion with this attribute raises one ability score by one point if it is currently 14 or higher; he raises it by 1d6 points if the ability score is less than 14.  This can raise a score to 19 or even 20 (in the case of some demihuman characters).  (Recall that an increase in Strength from 18/10 to 18/14 is considered a 4-point increase.) The abilities associated with each derivation are as follows:
^F02 
Anduiras	Charisma or Strength
Basaia		Intelligence
Brenna		Dexterity
Reynir		Constitution
Vorynn		Wisdom
Azrai		Charisma or Intelligence.
^F02 
^F11Iron Will
^F02Minor
Derivation:  Anduiras, Reynir, Azrai
Characters with iron will are tougher than ordinary characters. The mystic energy of their divine heritage allows them to persevere when lesser mortals tire or perish. This ability provides a character with 2 bonus hit points that are permanently added to his total. 
^F02 
^F11Protection from Evil
^F02Major
Derivations:  All except Azrai
A scion with this power is warded by a 10-foot aura of protection equal to that surrounding a paladin. Evil creatures suffer a -2 penalty to attacks against the character, and those within the area of effect are also at +2 for all saves. 
^F02 
^F11Regeneration
^F02Great
Derivation:   Anduiras, Reynir, Azrai
This powerful ability allows the scion to heal at an unnaturally rapid rate, recovering 1 hit point per each minute of real time. 
^F02 
^F11Resistance
^F02Minor, Major, Great
Derivations:  All
Some scions demonstrate an unusual resistance to certain types of attacks or spells. This resistance results in a 50% immunity to magic.
^F02 
^F11Travel
^F02Great
Derivations:  All except Anduiras and Reynir
This potent ability allows a scion to use a limited form of teleportation based on his derivation. Anything the character and his companions wear or carry are transported with him. A character may use this power once per adventure.
^F02 
^F05Blood and Regency
^F02 
When a child is born to a scion of an ancient bloodline, the child inherits the bloodline strength and derivation of one parent.  The child gains the bloodline derivation of the parent with the stronger bloodline, but the strength is diluted by the weaker bloodline.  The child's bloodline strength begins as the average of his parents' bloodline strengths.  For example, a father derived of Brenna with a strength of 40 and a mother derived of Reynir with a strength of 30 bear a child.  The child inherits the bloodline of Brenna with a strength of 35.
^F02 
A blooded child doesn't gain or lose bloodline strength based on the actions of parents or family.  If a blooded father is slain in battle by an awnshegh, his daughter's bloodline is not affected.  Similarly, if a blooded mother becomes the Great High Queen after her daughter's birth, the mother's increase in bloodline does not increase the daughter's strength.
^F02 
^F11Passing the Bloodline
^F02 
A regent can voluntarily pass his bloodline to another person by participating in a variation of the ceremony of investiture. The recipient of the bloodline increases his bloodline to the power of the donor, while the donor reduces himself to a bloodline strength of 0. In effect, the donor gives up all his heritage and passes it to another individual. If the recipient's bloodline strength is already stronger than that of the donor, the recipient's strength increases only minimally. 
^F02 
This altruistic act normally occurs when a parent has gone on great conquests and gained honor after the birth of a child, and wishes to pass the stronger bloodline to his offspring rather than allowing his powers to disappear upon his death.  A ruler without heirs might ennoble a trusted adviser and thus designate him as heir.
^F02 
Characters are rarely forced to give up their bloodlines, although the threat of death, use of hostages, mind-controlling enchantments, or similar dirty tricks may persuade them to participate in the investiture "voluntarily."
^F02 
^F05Regency (Character)
^F02 
While many scions and awnsheghlien wander Cerilia with noble heritages and potent blood abilities, their powers have little significance without a domain to control.  Blooded characters who control kingdoms are blessed with a mystical connection to the land -- a right to rule that infuses them with supernatural powers, responsibilities, and benefits.
^F02 
No one knows how this bond between ruler and domain occurs, but some scholars believe it is connected to the powers of confidence and belief -- in effect, the power of the ruler is derived from the fealty of his subjects.  Something in the semi-divine blood of a noble scion responds to the allegiance of his followers in the same way that a true deity gains strength from worshippers.
^F02 
Kings and nobles aren't the only rulers blessed with this mystical ability.  Charismatic priests derive the same kind of power from the confidence of their congregations.  Merchant-princes and guildmasters enjoy the confidence of those who work for them or pay them tribute.  Even wizards gain power from the respect of the masses.
^F02 
Because every ruler and every domain is unique, the people of Cerilia refer to these individuals as regents.  In this sense of the word, they're stewards of power who hold both the trust of the people and responsibility for the land.  The mystic power that regents derive from their stewardship is known as divine right, karma, or nobility -- but it's most commonly and correctly called regency.
^F02 
In game terms, regency is measured by a Regency Points (RP) score, just like hit points and bloodline strength.  Not all blooded characters gain a Regency Point score -- only regents amass a Regency Point score! Scions who choose not to rule domains never gain Regency Points, nor do characters without a divine bloodline.
^F02 
A ruler's Regency Points can be used to increase the power of his bloodline (possibly gaining new blood abilities) or to increase the success of ruling his domain (described in Part II).
^F02 
^F05Usurpation (Bloodtheft)
^F02 
When two scions meet in battle and one dies, special circumstances may allow the slayer to gain part of the victim's bloodline power.  The scions of Cerilia discovered this strange condition soon after the events at Mount Deismaar.  The resulting betrayals and feuds among Cerilia's scions have contributed to more than a thousand years of ceaseless wars.
^F02 
If a blooded character dies a natural death or perishes at the hand of a commoner, his bloodline is unaffected, and all his bloodline characteristics die with him.  If a regent character dies in a similar manner, his heir assumes the regent's domain and his Regency Point score.  The heir does not gain any blood strength or abilities (but may still gain material possessions).
^F02 
If a scion or regent dies as a result of another blooded character piercing him through the heart, the victim's heir assumes his domain, but the victim's Regency Points are lost. (The act of piercing the regent through the heart must be the killing blow. Piercing the regent's heart after he is dead does not affect the transference of regency or bloodline.) 
^F02 
A regent's heir need not be his child; the heir may be a lieutenant or even a commoner who lives up to the ideals of the bloodline.  Regents always actively choose their heirs.
^F02 
^F05Tighmaevril
^F02 
The rarest cases of bloodtheft occur when a scion is killed with a weapon made of tighmaevril (tih-MEE-vril), or bloodsilver.  The killer adds part of the victim's bloodline strength to his own bloodline and severs the tie between land and king.  The victim's domain thus becomes uncontrolled, and his heirs gain no Regency Points.
^F02 
Tighmaevril is a rare allow created by an elf smith named Ghoigwnnwd over 2,000 years ago.  He was the only person who ever knew the secret of working the metal, and made about a dozen tighmaevril weapons.  The weapons were first prized for their strength and beauty.  Their unusual properties remained undiscovered until one such weapon was used to kill a scion.
^F02 
^F02 
^F06Part II:  Monsters and Awnsheghlien
^F02 
Cerilia is plagued by dangerous natural predators, bloodthirsty bandits and pirates, tribes of humanoid marauders, and the dark forces of the awnsheghlien.  Naturally, these perils are only a distant threat to people residing in the Anuirean heartland or in a Khinasi city-state, but wild mountains and deep forests (and their dangerous denizens) are no more than a week's ride from even the most civilized parts of Cerilia.
^F02 
^F11Major Adversaries
^F02 
While hundreds of different species of dangerous creatures inhabit Cerilia, not all are common enough or malign enough to pose a significant threat to human lands.  However, certain monsters can and do destroy human settlements whenever they can.  Only 40 years ago, the Brecht city of Adlersburg in Wierech was stormed by an army of goblins and ogres out of the Gorgon's Crown and reduced to a smoking ruin.  Similar incidents on smaller scales have occurred with increasing frequency in recent years as the former states of the Anuirean Empire have fallen into civil war and the strength of arms along the northern frontiers has diminished.
^F02 
^F10Giants
^F02 
The giants of Cerilia are elemental creatures, closely tied to the earth.  The stone, hill, forest, and mountain giants tend to be solitary, reclusive creatures who are disinterested in human affairs.  They're unlikely to attack humans unless the humans trespass in their territory or build settlements where they shouldn't (by giant standards).
^F02 
Unfortunately, the ice giants of the distant north and the evil fhoimorien are far more dangerous, and are fond of launching raids into the surrounding lands.
^F02 
^F10Gnolls
^F02 
Wandering maruaders and brigands, gnoll tribes have troubled the peoples of Cerilia since before the arrival of humankind.  Even the Anuirean heartland is not immune to harassment by gnoll marauders, although such an event is rare.  Gnolls are nomads and plunderers, existing from day to day with little thought of what the next day holds.
^F02 
^F10Goblins
^F02 
Goblin-kind includes goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears.  In fact, in Cerilia the term "goblin" can refer to all of these species, since all are part of goblin society.  The only real variations are in size and strength.  Goblins hold extensive realms including Thurazor and Markazor and the great khanate of Kal Kalathor.
^F02 
Goblins aren't considered monsters in a traditional sense, although no one wants them for neighbors.  Their kingdoms are strong and stable enough to stand as nations with laws, borders, and courts.  They engage in trade with nearby lands, hire themselves out as mercenaries, and occasionally strike deals with bordering lands.  However, goblins are short-tempered, avaricious, and violent; only a fool trusts goblins very far.
^F02 
Goblin society is loosely organized in tribes and clans.  The kingdom of Kal Kalathor comprises no less than 37 distinct tribes.  Goblin kings tend to be weak figures, unable to control their contentious supporters; however, from time to time a particularly powerful, intelligent, and dangerous goblin may forge an army of conquest from his squabbling subjects.
^F02 
Goblins live by herding livestock, mining, selling their services as mercenaries, and raiding.  They are slave holders, and the weak among them perform most hard labors.
^F02 
^F02 
^F11The Shadow World of Cerilia
^F02 
Cerilia has a dark counterpart -- a parallel world of cold, eternal twilight that exists when night falls over the land.  The intangible border between Cerilia and its sinister twin can be breached only by powerful magic, but this border is weak and vulnerable in places where great evil has occurred, and on the darkest winter nights.  Cerilians refer to this evil place as the Shadow World and believe that any supernatural evils such as undead and fiends come from there.
^F02 
Those few who have crossed over to the Shadow World report that it resembles a dark and distorted version of Cerilia  Mountains and rivers stand where similar features exist in the daylight world, but the land is cold and empty.  A musty, aged crypt may hold nothing but moldering bones in Cerilia, but if one were to enter the same crypt in the Shadow World -- or even on a night when the Shadow World was near -- wights, spectres, or worse might be encountered.
^F02 
Time flows differently in the Shadow Land.  Many dimensional magics such as dimension door and shadow walk use this property by creating short-lived passages through the Shadow World.  Wizards must be extremely careful of using these spells; more than one mage has vanished while using such a spell and never returned from the Shadow World.
^F02 
Halflings are said to have come from this place, fleeing a terrible danger.  Common folk everywhere tell terrifying stories of a Cold Rider who haunts the Shadow World.  He is known by many names throughout the land -- the Rjurik call him the Night Walker, while the Khinasi know him as the Darkling.  In any event, the borders between the Shadow World and Cerilia have grown weaker in recent years, and strange things have been happening in the frontier lands and wild places.
^F02 
^F02 
^F11The Awnsheghlien of Cerilia
^F02 
The awnsheghlien are the monstrous inheritors of evil bloodlines, in the same manner that player characters and some of their neighbors are heroic scions of good bloodlines.  Some of the awnsheghlien were present at the battle of Mount Deismaar, more than 1,500 years ago.  Others received their powers much later.  Regardless of their origins, the awnsheghlien continue to be the greatest danger facing Cerilia.
^F02 
Many awnsheghlien were once human, but the dark power running in their veins has warped and transformed them.  Their powers seem to create outward shapes or forms that match an awnshegh's blighted spirit.  The Gorgon and the Raven are excellent examples.  The Gorgon, with a heart of stone, has become increasingly stonelike over the years; his skin is cold and hard in appearance and touch.  The dark power is as much a curse as it is a reward; most awnsheghlien are tortured creatures, despising themselves as much as they do others.
^F02 
Some of the awnsheghlien were monsters who served in Azrai's armies.  The Kraken, the Spider, and the Serpent are examples of these.  In the years since, they have become even more monstrous.  Others such as the Hydra and the Minotaur came into their dark powers through misfortune or accident.  And from time to time, new awnsheghlien are created when bloodlines tainted by Azrai's derivation happen to breed true.  The Boar of Thuringode is one of these monstrosities.
^F02 
^F11Physical Appearance and Powers
^F02 
Although many awnsheghlien have names that match standard AD&D game monsters, the similarities stop there.  The Gorgon, for example, isn't the bull-like creature described in the Monstrous Manual.  Instead, he is a stony-skinned humanoid with horns, hooves, and giantlike strength.  Since he was once a great human warrior, he is skilled in the use of most weapons and specializes in his favorites.  Following are some characteristics of some awnsheghlien.
^F02 
Intelligence:	All awnsheghlien have at least Low Intelligence (5-7).  Some are geniuses.
^F02 
Alignment:	A few awnsheghlien are neutral, but the vast majority are evil.  A few, known as ehrsheghlien, are of good alignment.
^F02 
Armor Class:	Consider the appearance and age of the awnshegh.  The Gorgon is a stone-skinned humanoid; his base AC may be 0.  He is also old and intelligent enough to have acquired significant magical protections.
^F02 
Movement:	Apply any rating appropriate to the creature's physique or abilities.  Nothing about the Gorgon implies great speed, so 6 or 9 would be appropriate.
^F02 
Hit Dice:	An awnshegh that evolved from a human should have at least as many HD as it had in human form, possibly modified for superhuman Constitution.  The Gorgon was a 20th-level fighter, so his base Hit Dice are 9d10+33; his Constitution might be 20 or better, increasing HD to 9d10+78.
^F02 
THAC0:	Start with the THAC0 for the similar creature described in the Monstrous Manual and modify for strength and power.  A THAC0 of 1 for the Gorgon would be reasonable, but he may gain bonuses for strength or magic.
^F02 
No.  of Attacks:	As the awnshegh's original form or for the common creature.  The Gorgon can punch twice with his fists or use a weapon; he could attack five times per 2 rounds with a specialized weapon.
^F02 
Damage/Attack:	As the common creature, with possible bonuses for increased strength and power.  The Gorgon might inflict 1d8+8 points of damage with a punch; his damage with a weapon could include strength, specialization, and magic.
^F02 
Special Attacks:	Awnsheghlien should have unusual or unique attacks.  The Gorgon should have a gaze or breath weapon that turns victims to stone.  Other awnsheghlien may breathe fire, cast spells, spray poison, etc.
^F02 
Special Defenses:		Most awnsheghlien have unusual defensive powers.  The Gorgon's stony hide can be pierced only by a weapon of +2 or better enchantment.  Awnsheghlien may be naturally resistant to some spells; for example, the Gorgon is immune to any earth- or cold-based magic.  
^F02 
Magic Resistance:	This shouldn't be common among awnsheghlien, but a powerful abomination may have magic resistance of 20-30%.
^F02 
Awnsheghlien - Blood Abilities
^F02 
The physical enhancements of the awnsheghlien serve as their blood abilities.  The manifestations of divine heritage are different for monsters than they are for heroes.  However, any awnshegh might possess blood abilities normally associated with the heroic lines if the power seems logical and appropriate for the monster.
