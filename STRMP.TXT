NEWBLOCK

ACTION_TEXT0	Regents don't spend all of their time ruling their domain.  There are monsters to be fought, intrigues to be solved, castles to be stormed; in short, regents participate in the same activities as normal adventurers. If a PC regent wants to see what's over the next hill, he can ride off in search of fame and fortune.\n \nAdventures may reflect the activities of other regents or provocative random events.  An adventure uses one of the character's actions for the turn.

// Agitate
ACTION_TEXT1	A regent with a holding can use his influence to agitate or stabilize the province's loyalty toward its ruler.  A ruler can agitate in favor of himself.  A priest regent can do this once per domain turn as a free action.\n \nThe success number is increased by the difference between the active regent's holding and the province rating (it's easier to agitate when you have a substantial influence in a region).  If the ruler supports the effort, the ruler's law holding is subtracted from the success number; if the ruler is opposed, add the law holding's number to the success number.  The success percentage also can be modified by spending Gold Bars.

// Contest
ACTION_TEXT2	A regent can neutralize another regent's holding by contesting his influence.  If the attempt is successful, the contested holding does not generate Regency Points or Gold Bars for its owner.  A level 0 holding is destroyed by being contested.  The success number is modified by the difference between the attacker's holding (or province rating, if he's the ruler) and the contested holding.\n \nThe holding remains contested until the defender succeeds in a rule action.\n \nIf a contested holding is contested a second time, its owner loses the holding and its slots become uncontrolled.

// Create Holding
ACTION_TEXT3	A regent wishing to establish a holding in a province where he has no holdings may use create holding. This gives the regent a holding (0). He is then free to rule in order to increase the influence of his holding.\n \nCreation of a holding can be opposed or supported by any regent with a similar holding in the province, or by the province ruler. The interfering regent's holding or province rating is added to or subtracted from the success number without spending Regency Points. Any concerned party can spend Regency Points to influence the success chance.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE when there are so many holdings in Anuire that masons cannot be found.

// Declare War
ACTION_TEXT4	Any regent can declare war.  A regent must declare war before he can move military units into provinces that don't belong to him; if he doesn't declare war, he can make troop movements only within his own realm.\n \nSince no troop movement is allowed after the third realm action, you may only declare war as your first or second realm action.\n \nA declaration of war only lasts until the end of a domain turn, after which the parties return to neutral status.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE as a lieutenant action.

// Diplomacy
ACTION_TEXT5	Negotiations with other domains fall under the diplomacy action. Regents are assumed to maintain basic contact with their neighbors and pass routine messages back and forth. However, diplomacy as a domain action is a full-court affair designed to achieve a specific goal. You must, therefore, have a court to conduct diplomacy.\n \nDiplomacy may have the following effects:\n^t020Create an alliance,\n^t020Force concessions such as tribute or territory\n^t030from another regent\n^t020Request gold or grant salaries\n \nAlliances, tribute, and vassalage, unlike declarations of war, are durable and remain in effect from turn to turn unless broken by another action.\nWhen you forge an alliance (including vassalage) the two realms become closer friends.  Note that you must include some alliance event to maintain the loyalty level negotiated. Ask for an alliance (even the one you already have) if you want to permanently increase their reaction.

// Espionage
ACTION_TEXT6	Espionage includes any kind of spying or covert actions.  A thief regent may perform this once per domain turn as a free action.\n \nEspionage can reveal troop strengths and hidden troops, or assassinate a character or destroy a unit.\n \nThe success chance of an espionage attempt is a base of 20 improved by the level of the target province and the level of any guild holdings there controlled by the spying regent.

// Forge Ley Line
ACTION_TEXT7	Wizards may use this action to create a magical link between two provinces.  Many realm spells require a minimum source level in the province to be affected, but a ley line acts as a magical conduit, allowing the wizard to treat the weaker province as if it had the source level of a higher connected province for purposes of casting realm spells.\n \nLey lines cost 1 RP and 1 GB per province crossed; thus linking to a province three moves away costs 3 RP and 3 GB.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE to non-wizards.\n \nIn order to create a ley line you must have two sources that do not already have a ley line between them.

// Fortify
ACTION_TEXT8	Building strongholds in a domain is a good way to deter attack and tie up enemy forces in a war.\n \nFortification of a province creates a new holding for that area: a castle.  Before a province can be invested, the castle must be destroyed by siege.\n \nCastles cost 8 GB per level.  Work progresses at 1d6 GB per domain turn.

// Investiture
ACTION_TEXT9	The ceremony of investiture allows a regent to gain control of part of another regent's domain.  In order to invest a province, the province must have been conquered.  The conquering regent must then succeed in an investiture action.  The base success number is 10, and the conqueror must pay Regency Points equal to the level of the province.  He may pay additional Regency Points to improve his success chance.  The defender can bid Regency Points to oppose the investiture.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE as a lieutenant action.

// Lieutenant
ACTION_TEXT10	Normally, a hireling becomes a henchman only when he demonstrates loyalty and respect for a particular player.  Regents are different; they're besieged by people who want to work for them.  By spending a character action, the regent finds a lieutenant and adds him to his list of henchmen.\n \nLieutenants are excellent stand-ins when a regent is busy and can provide extra muscle for the regent's adventuring party.  The regent's Charisma score dictates the maximum number of henchmen who can work for him.\n \nFor this purpose, a scion of a minor bloodline can add 1 to his effective Charisma score; a scion of a major bloodline may add 2; a scion of a great bloodline may add 3.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE as a lieutenant action.

// Lieutenant Action
ACTION_TEXT11	One of a regent's lieutenants can conduct one lieutenant action per domain round.  This action is in addition to the regent's three realm turns.  The actions available for lieutenants are: adventure, agitate, contest, create holding, diplomacy, espionage, fortify, realm spell (if a wizard or priest), rule, or trade route.\n \nA lieutenant cannot spend additional Regency Points to improve the chance of success on his action, so his odds are less than if the regent had performed the action himself.  Normal costs in Gold Bars and Regency Points are spent.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE as a lieutenant action.

// Muster Armies
ACTION_TEXT12   A regent can create new army units by mustering troops, raising a levy, or hiring mercenaries in a province he rules. A province can raise non-mercenary military units equal to its level (never higher) in a single domain turn.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE if all available able-bodied fighters have already been recruited.

// Realm Spell
ACTION_TEXT13	A priest or wizard character can spend a domain action to cast a mighty enchantment that affects the entire province.  Realm spells are a special type of magic that are available only to Blooded spellcasters.  Without the power provided by an ancient bloodline and a tie to a temple or source holding, a realm spell would fail completely.  A realm spell can be used only in a province where a priest has a temple or a wizard has a source.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE to non-priest/non-wizard characters.

// Rule
ACTION_TEXT14	With this action, a regent spends time and energy advancing the causes of his domain.  By ruling, he can increase a province or holding's level by 1.  A province can be ruled only once per domain turn. Note that for a regent to increase a holding, a level must be vacant.\n \nRuling a holding costs 1 Gold Bar plus Regency Points equal to the target level.  The province ruler and any regent with a similar holding in the province can support or oppose the action by adding or subtracting the level of their own holdings.\n \nRuling a province costs 1 Gold Bar and 1 Regency Point per target level.\n \nIf someone has contested a holding, a successful rule action will return the holding to an uncontested status.

// Trade Route
ACTION_TEXT15	A regent who controls a guild holding can attempt to open a trade route, thereby increasing the money-making power of his domain.  A trade route must be established between two provinces of different terrain types.  Overland trade routes can't be created unless a road links the largest towns or center points of the two provinces involved.  Furthermore, provinces of level 1 to 3 are limited to one trade route; level 4 to 6 may have no more than two trade routes; level 7 and above can support three.\n \nEach domain turn, a trade route generates GB's equal to the average of the two provinces it links.  In addition, thief regents who control trade routes collect RP equal to the extra money generated by trade route.

// Build Road
ACTION_TEXT16	Roads are required for overland trade routes, and also speed troop movement. A road can be crucial in mountainous or heavily wooded areas. A road costs the sum of the Terrain Movement Costs of the two provinces the road goes between; thus, building a road from a hilly province (2GB) to a province in the plains (1GB) would cost 3 Gold Bars.\n \nA road will go from province center to province center and will be considered to provide a link between any holdings, towns, or castles in those two provinces.\n \nRoads can be built into other regent's provinces that are adjacent to your realm if you have an alliance with that regent.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE as a lieutenant action.

// Hold Action
ACTION_TEXT17	Often, when ruling your realm, it may be best to simply wait for more gold, for more regency, for more troops to be available, or for a fortification to be completed. Or, perhaps, just to see what your busy neighbor is up to. For those cases, select the Hold Action.  That action round is simply forfeited.\n \nNOT AVAILABLE as a lieutenant action.

//Taxation
ACTION_TEXT18	Ruling a domain is expensive.  Fortunately, regents can collect money from their subjects.  Rulers levy taxes, guilds generate income, and priests collect offerings.  Regents may have great responsibilities, but with care, they can muster the resources to meet them.  In this step of the domain turn, all active regents collect money from their domains.  Because of the potentially large sums involved, it's easiest to work with blocks of money called Gold Bars, or GB.  (Don't confuse these with gp, or gold pieces.)  One Gold Bar is worth about 2,000 gp.  First, province rulers can declare taxation levels. The regent decides for each province whether to impose light, moderate, or severe taxation, then collects the funds by pressing this button.  Of course, severe taxation doesn't win the regent much support among his subjects, but light taxes generally make a regent more popular.

// Domain Maintenance
ACTION_TEXT19	The strength of a kingdom is measured not only by the power of its ruler and armies, but also by its economic health.  Many regents have ruined their lands through careless fiscal policies.  Each domain turn, the regent must cover the expenses of his government.  Each castle, fortified holding, and occupied province (a foreign province held by the regent's troops) costs 1 GB; if the regent fails to pay, the castle or fortification's level drops by one or the province rebels.  The regent must also pay a maintenance cost for his provinces and holdings.  The computer determines the correct maintenance for you by counting the number of provinces and law, guild, and temple (but not source) holdings in your domain.\n \nIf the regent can't meet expenses, he must disband army units or reduce court costs to meet his kingdom's demands.

// Payroll
ACTION_TEXT20	Regents must pay the maintenance costs of any military units under their command.  If a unit goes unpaid, it disbands unless the regent spends 5 Regency Points for each GB he owes it.  If mercenaries are unpaid, they desert and become brigands, who will then raid your holdings until driven off by your armies.

// Court value
ACTION_TEXT21	Regents don't live like paupers.  Each active regent must spend money to hold court and support his staff each domain turn.  The regent decides how much he wants to spend, but, generally, the more he spends, the more opulent and impressive his court is. If a regent has no court, he cannot initiate diplomacy.

// Collect Taxation
ACTION_TEXT22	Press this button to determine the actual taxes collected from your provinces and holdings. If you end up with a negative treasury, you must adjust your finances until you have a positive balance. You can try lowering your court expenditures (You will do worse in diplomacy.), not maintaining some of your holdings (They go down in level.), or not paying your troops (They will disband; mercenaries will become bandits.). But, you must balance the books. Such is the burden of regency.

// Realm Actions
ACTION_TEXT23	Once you are done with the realm maintenance, click here to move on to domain actions.  Now that you have some money and regency to work with, it is time to spend your resources on your plans for ruling your kingdom and interacting with the other kingdoms and regents of Anuire.

ACTION_TEXT24	A regent may need to make difficult choices for the good of his realm.  Occupying a province with troops, whether one of your own provinces or that of a foreign foe can cause hardship for the civilians.\n \nYou may choose to declare martial law and occupy your own provinces so that you may remove undesirable holdings from your realm.  Likewise, newly occupied foreign provinces can be purged of foreign influences.  This measure, while seemingly desirable, will cause friction with your neighbors.\n \nLess beneficent rulers may choose to pillage an occupied province, either to reduce the province's value or just to raise needed gold.\n \nYou must occupy before you may INVEST a province.  Contested and rebellious provinces do not count as occupied.  Occupying a province with as many units as its Civ Level will reduce rebellion.

STR_OPENING_DIALOG_MSG_1 	Welcome to Ruidewash Keep. This short adventure will help you learn the skills to successful adventuring. To move, use the arrow keys to walk forwards or backwards, and to turn left and right. To look up and down use the PgUp and PgDn keys, and to side step use the Ins and Del keys. For a complete list of keyboard commands, press F1 for the HELP menu, then select Quick Keys. For now, though, press the up arrow key to walk down the hallway ahead of you to the first door.

STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_1     In front of you is a door. To open the door, walk up close enough to it so that it fills the screen, then press the space bar.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_2     On the other side of this room is one of Cariele's goblin mercenaries, hiding behind a pillar. As you walk through the room, he will attack as you come into his view. When the fight begins, the camera will pull back to the side so that both fighters are in the field of view.\n   You will default to a defend mode of fighting in which you can do no damage to your foe. Head towards him, and when you get closer I will explain your combat options.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_3     In front of you is a small ledge. To get up there, press the 'A' key to jump as you walk forward. If you start too close you will bounce off, so back up and try again.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_4     There is a wide pit up ahead. To jump over it, you will need to be running. Run by pressing the SHIFT key while moving. Just as you get to the edge of the pit, press the 'A' key to jump. Try this a few times to get the hang of long jumps.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_5     In front of you is a switch on the wall that controls a door or moving platform somewhere in the building. Walk up to the switch until it fills the screen, then press the space bar to activate it. Quickly turn to your right to watch the secret door open.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_6     On the floor ahead of you is a potion of flying. It's in the black bottle. Click on the potion with your left-mouse button to pick it up and add it to your inventory. (You can right-mouse button click on an object to identify it.)\n   Once you have it, walk up to the edge of the pit, and I will give you instructions on its use.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_7     In front of you is a necklace of missiles, a potent magical weapon. Use your mouse to pick it up. Open your inventory box as before and click on magic items. Click on the necklace to select, and press '1' to place it into your hot box number 1. Thereafter, you can use that item by pressing '1'. Close the inventory box and continue down the hall.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_8     Now you get to use your necklace. In front of you is one of Cariele's foul goblin mercenaries. He might be too tough for us to fight hand-to-hand, so let's try our necklace on him. Press the '1' key to activate the Necklace of Missiles. You will notice the cursor has changed to a target. Put the cursor on the goblin and left-click on him. If for some reason you do not want to use this item, then right-click to cancel. If you have trouble, move forward some more to improve your view of the target and try again.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_9     That should get you started. There are other things to discover and learn.\n   Read the on-line help for more information, and try some of the other adventures to see additional tricks and traps.  When you have finished, get the Regalia of Empire on the shelf in the back. If you remember, that's what we came here for in the first place. You will need to get the Potion of Flying to reach it. When you have the Regalia, click on EXIT ADVENTURE to leave Ruidewash Keep with your recovered treasures.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_10    To your right is a locked door, and in front of you to the left is a key. Try to open the door first, so you will recognize what a locked door looks like in the future. Then, pick up the key by left-clicking on it and try the door again. Now, it opens easily. The key is in your inventory (press the 'I' key or click the Inventory button) under Items.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_11    ~
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_12    Now that you are almost upon him, let me explain your combat options. To attack him, click on any of the four attack options next to your portrait on the control panel. Or, you can press 'X' for attack style 1, 'C' for attack style 2, or SHIFT 'X' and 'C' for fast versions of those attacks. Each type of attack may work better on different foes. Watch your attack status display for odds of hitting and damage done by each style of attack for each new type of foe you face. Notice that your magic users only have one attack mode (plus its fast equivalent). They have more magic usage options to compensate.\n   When you have defeated the raider, head to the door on the right side of the back wall.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_13    To use the potion, open your inventory box by clicking the INVENTORY button or pressing the 'I' key. Click on the button that says MAGIC ITEMS. This shows you all the magic items you currently have in your inventory. Click on the Potion of Flying, and click USE.\n   When you are ready to go, close the inventory box by pressing DONE.\n   With the Potion of Flying in effect, you can fly by holding down the 'A' key to rise, the 'Z' key to descend, and the arrow keys to maneuver. There are several potions down in the pit in case you don't make it to the opposite ledge the first time.
STR_TUTORIAL_MSG_14    As you go into this room you will see a few other things you might find in an adventure. To the left you will see a room you must crouch down to get into. Do this by pressing the 'Z' key to crouch while you use the arrows to crawl through the short tunnel. To the right is a pool of lava. You can jump over this or run through it. You will take damage from contact with the lava, so don't take too long.\n   Now, continue into this room, and get the magic items. Experiment with them.

STR_DESCRIPTION_BASE   placeholder
STR_DESCRIPTION_1      ^g02:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264When Anuire was still united as a single empire, it was ruled by the last of the great emperors, Michael Roele. In his youth, Michael was betrayed by the Duke of Boeruine, kidnapped by goblins of Thurazor, rescued by the elves of Tuarhievel, and engaged in innumerable adventures of renown. His exploits made him recognized throughout Anuire as one of the greatest heroes of the time, and the people loved him.\n\n   When Michael assumed the Iron Throne as a young and untried ruler, his empire was in turmoil, with revolts and rebellions all about. Michael personally led his troops to put down these revolts, proving in battle after battle that he was one of the greatest military commanders ever seen in Anuire. ^g05
STR_DESCRIPTION_2      ^g02:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264Through statesmanship and canny diplomatic skill, Michael Roele welded the quarrelsome kingdoms of Anuire into a powerful state, working together for the betterment of all. Anuire became the greatest empire that Cerilia had ever seen until Michael's untimely death at the hands of The Gorgon.\n\n    The chaos that ensued with Michael Roele's death has brought horror and destruction to the peoples of Anuire for generations. None since him have had the combination of personal heroism, military brilliance, and political acumen needed to weave an empire out of the conflicting threads of our shattered state. If you are indeed the one to become the new emperor of Anuire, you must show the world that you possess the traits of Michael Roele. ^g05
STR_DESCRIPTION_3      ^g02:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264You have much to learn before you can hope to convince the people you are worthy of the Iron Throne. You are fortunate indeed that you have relations who are willing to help with your training. Your cousins, Fhiele and Daeric Dhoesone, are willing to give you the opportunity to learn the arts of leadership.\n   Daeric, the steward of Dhoesone, will teach you to conduct a successful adventure and command a battle. Most importantly, though, Daeric will teach you how to manage the economy of a great realm without overburdening its citizens with unjust taxes. He will also teach you the skills of the diplomat and how to win and retain allies as you contest with your enemies and expand your kingdom. Select Tutorial Game from the Begin Game Menu to receive this training. Start with the Basic tutorial first. When you have mastered those skills, you can try the more advanced tutorials. ^g05
STR_DESCRIPTION_4      ^g02:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 When you have completed Daeric's training, you can get additional experience adventuring or in conducting battles by selecting the Adventures Only or Battles Only from the New Game Menu. Adventures Only takes you to the Adventurer's Guild where you join the greatest heroes of the realm to recover some of the precious, lost artifacts of the old empire. You can gain more adventure experience with the guild than you will get in years of ruling a realm. And, that experience may prove invaluable when adventures affect the future of your bloodline and the destiny of your realm.\n   Similarly, Battles Only takes you to the War College, where you can build the experience you will need to conduct battles during your reign. Again, you can gain more experience here in the art of war in Anuire than you will gain in years as a regent. The choice is yours, though. Take the training now or try your luck as a regent and claim your birthright. ^g06

STR_ADVENTURE_1        ^g30:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 \nSo, you think you have the makings of a hero, do you? Well, I doubt it. I think you're just another spoiled offspring of a weak-willed regent, sent here to be out from underfoot of your betters back home. No matter, though. We always need another bearer on our little outings.\n \n   Take a look at our files. We have a number of chores that the empire would like to see handled. The pay is good, if you survive. You will get the opportunity to work with some of the greatest real heroes in all of Anuire. There are always a few here at the guild, ready to head off, so look over their credentials and see if you think any can stand to work with you. You can take four on any given adventure, so choose carefully. ^g05
STR_ADVENTURE_2        ^g30:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 \nIf you don't see what you are looking for, use the RESTART SCENARIOS control to ask for more choices of companions. You should know, though, that any experience and treasures you have built up will be forfeit at that time. If you ask for new companions, you start over from scratch. Once you've picked an adventure and chosen some fit companions, be sure to equip the magic users before heading off. Then, see if you can complete the quests and bring back the goods. Your fellow adventurers will treat you with proper courtesy, since you are of noble birth. But, courtesy is all you get for free. You'll have to earn their respect. If you can.^g06

STR_BATTLE_1           ^g31:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 \nWelcome, all you lily-livered, whining pukes from the noble houses of Anuire. The War College of Anuire was founded by Chamberlain Dosiere in the hope that the troops of our shattered empire could be trained in fighting skills, and the potential commanders could get some experience leading troops before they were dumped into a real battle.\n \n   The troops usually do pretty well here, but most of the so-called 'leaders' that are sent to us just never make the grade. I have played wet nurse to hundreds of spoiled brat 'nobles' that thought they were fit to command simply because they were born with a blood ability. And this lot looks worse than most. ^g05
STR_BATTLE_2           ^g31:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 \nBut, I'll do what I can, and maybe one or two of you will surprise me. Here at the War College, we will stage dozens of mock battles. We have some of the finest illusionists in Anuire working to insure that the battles look real, that the magic looks dangerous. While nobody actually gets killed out there, you'd better act like they do. You have to show that you can command a battle with any mix of forces and win the day despite the odds and without needlessly expending your troops. If you do well, you will earn your Commander's stripes. A few of you may become great generals. If any of you can master all of our lessons, you will be proclaimed Warlord of Anuire. But then, nobody has ever done that yet, and you sure don't look like you'll make it to Commander, much less any farther. ^g05
STR_BATTLE_3           ^g31:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 \nYou should work your way through the lessons from the beginning. Or, you can select your own practice sessions using any mix of troops that you choose. But, only the formal lessons count towards your credentials. You must complete them all if you wish the highest honors. So, candidate, what are you standing around here for? Get out there, and get to work before you make me lose my lunch. ^g06
STR_BATTLE_4           unused

STR_BTLTUT_WELCOME			^g31:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 Welcome to your first battle. I will help you familiarize yourself with the commands available and some of the strategies to consider in a battle. After defeating this rogue band of Gnolls, and learning how to run a realm, you may consider further battle training (see Battles Only in the New Game menu) to learn some of the finer points of army combat. There is also extensive on-line help available (Main Menu - Help section) to get all the information a great general needs to be successful. To succeed on the battlefield, you must either kill all the enemy units, or hold a four to one majority over the enemy. Be careful, though, because this can work against you. You must have your troops on the field. If too many have fallen or retreated to the reserves, you will lose the battle. Another point to remember is that mounted units get a charge bonus for initiating combat, and foot soldiers like our archers do not.^g06
STR_BTLTUT_RESERVES			^g31:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 When you begin a battle, all of your troops are in your reserves. This is the box in the lower left corner of the screen. To move a unit onto the battlefield, left-click on the unit you want. You will notice the grid in the lower right will highlight with all of your available choices. You cannot move a unit into a square that is already occupied by your own forces, or is impassable, marked with a red slash through the square. Now pick a unit (I would humbly suggest your archer unit) and place it in the middle square of the highlighted row. I will refer to this row as the back row, as it is the one closest to our side. If you select them (click on the force itself or on their map icon image), the camera will follow the unit as it moves. You can also move the camera with the arrow keys, or pull back for a broad perspective with the command view button. ^g06
STR_BTLTUT_MOVEMENT			^g31:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 Now that your unit has arrived on the battlefield, we can begin to rid ourselves of these gnolls. Your archers may not be in front of the gnolls. To move them, you should click on the unit, either in the battlefield grid located in the lower right, or on the actual unit in the viewport at the top. Now move your cursor left or right depending on where the gnolls are. If you are using the field you will see the cursor change to a move cursor. In the battlefield grid move the cursor over the highlighted square you want. When you have your cursor where you want your troops to move, then click. Click the Reserves control to get at your knights. When you bring your knights out, you will use the same movement technique, but you will want to initiate combat. To do this move the knights into the square containing the gnolls. ^g06
STR_BTLTUT_ARCHERS			^g31:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 The gnolls have just moved into bow shot range of one of your archers. Select your missile troops that have an enemy unit in one of the four adjacent, not diagonal, squares. Select your archer force, then move your cursor over the enemy unit in either the battle grid or on the field until an arrow cursor appears. Click the mouse to fire. After your unit reloads, they will announce 'Archers ready', and you can fire again the same way.^g06
STR_BTLTUT_ENGAGEMENT		^g31:128,088^g00:160,120,320,264 Your troops have just become engaged. If you wish to get them out of combat, click on them either on the grid or the field.  You will be given the choice of either falling back or canceling. Your troops cannot fall back if there are no open spaces for your troops to fall back to.^g06

STR_BASIC_042	^g02:457,040^g00:489,072,150,304The first step before any adventure is to choose the members of our group to go. We can have a maximum of four people on an adventure. Right now, only three are available, Fhiele Dhoesone and your two lieutenants. Later on, after more lieutenants join you, you can pick and choose whom you want to take. For now, let's send everybody. Click in the boxes next to each name so that a check mark appears, indicating they are to go. ^g05
STR_BASIC_043	^g02:457,040^g00:489,072,150,304Whenever a wizard or a priest is going adventuring, before they set out, they need to memorize the spells that they may want to use on the adventure. Left click a mage's name to see his list of spells. The lower box will have a list of numbers separated by slashes. These numbers represent the number of spells of each level that the character is able to memorize. The numbers go from level 1 spells on the left to the highest spell level that the mage is capable of learning on the right. ^g05
STR_BASIC_044	^g02:457,040^g00:489,072,150,304Click the spell name for a description and click the MEMORIZE button or the '+' next to the spell name to memorize an instance of that spell. You may wish to memorize several instances of your favorite spell since each one memorized can only be used once. Click the FORGET button or the '-' to forget one. ^g05
STR_BASIC_045	^g02:457,040^g00:489,072,150,304While you can look at your other inventory items, only spells need to be prepared before going on the adventure. If you wish to, however, you can give an item from one character to another by selecting GIVE and then a recipient. ^g05
STR_BASIC_046	^g02:457,040^g00:489,072,150,304When all characters have finished memorizing spells and adjusting inventories, you're ready for your adventure. Press the ^C064Go on Adventure^C000 button to head out.^g06

With the recent death of the old Baron, and with Fhiele Dhoesone off adventuring, we were in dire need of the assistance you have so graciously consented to offer.\n   I have acted as the steward of Dhoesone for many years and will serve you in that capacity, handling many of the daily chores of running the kingdom while I train you to be a regent. ^g20^g10^g12^g05
STR_BASIC_002							^g02:000,032^g00:032,072,150,304As we progress through the training, if you choose to not follow the directions that I provide or if you simply make a mistake, my instruction may no longer match the events unfolding within your realm. In that case, I ask that you simply begin again. The entire training program takes such a short time that you will be ruling your own realm very shortly, I assure you. ^g05
STR_BASIC_003							^g02:000,032^g00:032,072,150,304I realize that you know our realm of Dhoesone is the northernmost in all of Anuire, but if you will join me at the map, we should examine the realm. With your pointer, please click here on Dhoesone to magnify it. You may also use the '+' and '-' keys on the keypad to select other magnification levels. You can move about the map by left-clicking with your pointer on unoccupied points (clicking on a force will select it for movement commands) or by using the arrow keys. ^g04:378,073^g05
STR_BASIC_004							^g02:000,032^g00:032,072,150,304You can zoom the map out to show all of Anuire using the full map button here in the lower right corner of the screen. For detailed info about forces, castles, or provinces, right-click on the object or location that you wish information about. Zoom in again on Dhoesone and try that now, then press the MORE button. Notice the different types of information available. That force icon next to our castle in Sonnelind represents Fhiele Dhoesone. Right-clicking on it brings up her status display. ^g03:600,434^g05
STR_BASIC_005							^g02:000,032^g00:032,072,150,304You may notice that as you magnify the map, the names of each province in each realm appear. Beneath each province name are two numbers. The first number indicates the civilization level or population of the province. The second number is the magic level. Generally, the higher that one number is, the lower the other. ^g05
STR_BASIC_006							^g02:000,032^g00:032,072,150,304While acting as regent, you will control many holdings, or properties, throughout Dhoesone. To see them all, click on each of these controls to display your Law Holdings, Guild Holdings, Temple Holdings, and Source Holdings. Notice the small shield in the corner of each holding's picture. This indicates its owner. Our shield is gold and silver. ^g03:472,434^g05
STR_BASIC_007							^g02:000,032^g00:032,072,150,304The level, or strength, of each holding is indicated by the size of its picture on the map. Again, you can right-click on each holding's picture for more information about it.\n   You'll notice that you control substantial law and source holdings, but neither temples nor guilds. The organized religions in Dhoesone are controlled by independent religious groups, and the major guild holdings belong to Cariele, as indicated by their green and brown shields. ^g05
STR_BASIC_008 ^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Every domain turn you can select three major domain actions to accomplish, each of which takes you one month to finish. So, each turn represents one season of the year. The command buttons to the left are the domain actions you may choose. For now, let's start with the simplest to explain. Press the ^C064HOLD^C000 command to skip your first domain action, then click OK when prompted. You may often wish to wait for events to unfold or for more resources to become available before you issue more active commands. For now, let's see what events unfold. ^g13:011^g01:049,296



// TURN 1, DOMAIN ACTION 2: RECRUIT A FIGHTER
STR_BASIC_011							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264There are many people of great talent in Anuire who could help you in your quests. One way to obtain additional help is to recruit a lieutenant. Different classes of lieutenants-- fighters, priests, thieves, and wizards -- are available. Within each class are varying skill levels. To recruit one, you will left-click on the ^C064HIRE LIEUTENANT^C000 control. ^g12^g13:013^g01:049,352
STR_BASIC_012							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264A scroll of lieutenants available for hire with the name, class, and level of each will appear. To see the STATUS of an individual, right-click on their name. From the STATUS scroll, you can left-click on MOVE to see them in action. You cannot check their inventories, though, until you actually hire them. When finished, left-click on DONE to return to the list of candidates. ^g05
STR_BASIC_013							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264After looking over the choices available, I suggest we select the highest level fighter we can. If no fighters are available this time, then choose a wizard, priest or thief, and we'll get a fighter later.\n   To recruit your new help, left-click on the name. A recruiting cost in gold will appear at the bottom of the scroll. Make your selection and left-click on DONE to hire.

// TURN 1, DOMAIN ACTION 3: FIGHT MONSTERS AND HOLD
STR_BASIC_021							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Dire news, my liege. A report has come of a band of gnolls terrorizing the farmers in the province of Hidaele. Right-click on the troop icon in Hidaele to learn what you can about the gnolls. They are foul creatures that raid our farmsteads whenever the guard is not around. We must send troops there at once to drive them off or destroy them. Fortunately, we have mounted knights at the ready in the northern border province of Dharilein. Gnolls are pretty tough creatures, and our knights may not be sufficient to defeat them. We should muster some archers to help in the fight. ^g21:929,320^g12^g05
STR_BASIC_022							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Mustering troops is a free action, not counting against your limit of three per season. When you muster troops, you can select which provinces you wish to muster them in and how many and what type of troop you wish to muster. Each turn, you can raise troops in a province equal to its civilization level. Select ^C064MUSTER TROOPS^C000 now. ^g13:015^g01:049,408
STR_BASIC_023							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Displayed is a list of all the provinces that we control. We can muster troops in any or all of them. Let's select Riveside for now. To muster a unit of archers, click on the '+' next to archers. A running calculation of the cost in gold bars to muster the selected troops will be shown at the bottom of the scroll. When you have selected the maximum number of units for a province, the '+' symbols will all dim. If you realize that you'd prefer to muster a different type of troop, click the '-' next to the number. ^g12^g05
STR_BASIC_024							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264 To see the fighting statistics of a type of unit, right-click on its name and its battle card will appear. Clear the card with another mouse click. We only need the one force of archers. So, for now, let's only muster that one troop. Once you are satisfied with the types and numbers of units you have selected, click on MUSTER. The units list will clear, so that only the list of provinces remains. You could choose a different province and muster armies there as well. Once you have mustered all the desired armies, click DONE. ^g05
STR_BASIC_025							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Moving troops is another free action, so you may move as many as you want during each round. To send troops, left-click on them, then click on the province that you wish them to move to. Click on the province itself, not on the units within it. It costs gold for each troop movement where there are no roads, so do not move troops unnecessarily. Move the knights of Dharilein into Hidaele. When they encounter the gnolls, they will halt. Battles will not be fought until all troop movements are complete, so you should next move the archers of Riveside east to join this battle. ^g21:929,320^g05
STR_BASIC_026							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Forces can be moved beyond adjacent provinces, so we should send the archers directly to Hidaele. When they reach Hidaele, you will be prompted to join them with the troop of knights. You should join them so they can fight the gnolls together. ^g21:929,320^g05
STR_BASIC_027							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264When all your troops are ready, click on the ^C064HOLD^C000 control to signify that you are done with troop movements. Any other action command could be used, but let's just do a Hold action for now so we can get on with our battle. Click OK to confirm the hold action and to engage the forces. You will be given the choice to retreat and forfeit this battle, to command the forces personally, or have your troop commanders handle it for you. For this conflict, let's command it ourselves. ^g13:011^g01:049,296

// TURN 2, COUNSELOR'S REPORT: INTRODUCE PROVINCES AND HOLDINGS REPORT
STR_BASIC_031							^g00:009,341,622,091   We have accomplished much, my liege. In the past three months, we have recruited a lieutenant, mustered a troop of archers, and fought your first battle. You have done well. At the end of each season, your key advisers assemble to deliver whatever reports you choose to hear. I, acting as Chamberlain, along with your General, Mage, and Spy Master are ready to advise you on the state of Dhoesone and the events in Anuire that may affect us. At this time, you should listen to each adviser's introductory report. As you finish each report, click on it to put it away again. ^g05
STR_BASIC_032							^g00:009,341,622,091   Let's also take a look at the^C064 REALM STRENGTH^C000 report by left-clicking on that button. At the top of this report is the information for our kingdom of Dhoesone.\n   Next to Dhoesone's name is a current point score. The score is based on the combined value of controlled provinces, existing alliances, and relics of power which have been recovered on adventures. In order to be recognized by all in Anuire as the rightful claimant to the Iron Throne, you must accumulate 300 points. ^g05
STR_BASIC_033							^g00:009,341,622,091   Next to the score are two bar graphs, one in green, blue, and purple showing provinces owned, allied, and in vassalage to you and one in red showing holdings.\n   Below the information about Dhoesone, the report shows identical information for the current 10 leading contenders for the Iron Throne. This information is provided so that you can recognize the kingdoms that you may want to ally with or attempt to weaken. ^g05
STR_BASIC_034							^g00:009,341,622,091   When you are through reviewing the Realm Strength report, click on it to put it away. While we're here, let's also check the ^C064 ADVENTURE NEWS^C000 to see what opportunities may be available to us. When you have read that report, put it away as well, then click the DONE control to continue.

// TURN 2, DOMAIN ACTION 1: GO ON AN ADVENTURE
STR_BASIC_041							^g02:457,040^g00:489,072,150,304During the briefing by your advisers, we were informed that one of our border forts had been over-run by raiders from Cariele. In the single player game, this would be an opportunity for you to go off adventuring, searching the fort for raiders and fighting them face to face, building up character levels. But, in the multi-player mode of play, adventures are not available, as they keep the other players waiting too long while you play. So, for now, just press ^C064HOLD^C000 to skip the adventure. ^g12^g13:011^g01:049,296

// TURN 2, FREE ACTION AND DOMAIN ACTION 2: MUSTER TROOPS & DIPLOMACY
STR_BASIC_051							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed your little outing. Those raiders that Cariele sent against us may be nothing more than their usual border harassment, but with the Duke newly dead and Baroness Fhiele away, we should be very cautious. Perhaps we should increase the troops all along our borders with Cariele to discourage their incursions. Let's muster one troop of infantry in each of our border provinces. ^g12^g13:015^g01:049,408
STR_BASIC_052							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264We currently have a permissive alliance with our neighbor, Thurazor. In order to further strengthen our borders, let's use diplomacy to improve that relationship to a full alliance. Select^C064 DIPLOMACY^C000, then Thurazor. You'll notice that in order to obtain a full alliance, they must like us 95 percent. Click in the box next to Seek Full Alliance so that it contains a check mark. ^g12^g13:007^g05
STR_BASIC_053							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264In order to make Thurazor like us more, we must offer them something of value. We could offer them a territory, but a holding and some gold should be adequate. The holding increases their reaction to us by 5 percent per holding level, and the gold by 2 percent per gold bar. In the advanced or expert games, we could also offer tribute, which requires paying them the agreed upon amount of gold each turn from now on. ^g05
STR_BASIC_054							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264As you click on the '+' to offer gold bars, keep an eye on the percentage of liking. Once it reaches 95 percent, a success roll will automatically appear at the bottom of the scroll. We could add more gold to the pot to better the success roll odds, or we can use our regency to make success more likely. Let's use regency (our political power, received from all our holdings) by clicking  on the plus button until success reads 100 percent. Press ROLL to see if we succeed in this action, then DONE. ^g06

// TURN 2, DOMAIN ACTION 3: DIPLOMACY TO RECRUIT
STR_BASIC_061							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264While your cousin, Clumine Dhoesone, is an able mage, he is not known for his ability with those magics useful on the field of battle. I think the time has come to seek a truly powerful mage to join with us as we prepare for war. The most powerful magic users cannot be simply recruited. You must negotiate with them as you would another realm to obtain their vassalage. Click the^C064 DIPLOMACY^C000 control to see who may be available. ^g12^g13:007^g01:049,240
STR_BASIC_062							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264The diplomacy list includes all the realms of Anuire, as well as the major organizations that have extensive holdings. It also includes representatives of the more powerful independent individuals who have holdings. They are toward the end of the list. It is these individuals that we are interested in. Right-click on each to check their credentials. Almost any magic user who has a representative at our court will be powerful enough to meet our needs, but let's select the Wizard Eyeless One since he is already a full ally of Dhoesone. ^g05
STR_BASIC_063							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264To convert a powerful ally into a vassal, we must request an oath of fealty and raise his loyalty level significantly. We will probably need to offer a holding and gold to persuade him to become our vassal. The holding will improve his reaction to us by 5 percent per level. If we succeed in winning the vassalage of this mage, we will have control of all of his holdings, so this cost is not significant to us. ^g05
STR_BASIC_064							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Next, try offering some gold. In the advanced and expert games, we could also offer salary, which must be paid every three months. While salary is more effective, the single payment of gold is cheaper in the long run. Juggle these offerings until the reaction reaches 150 percent, the amount required for an oath of fealty from The Eyeless One. If the Success level is less than 100 percent, use some regency to raise it so that we cannot fail, then press the ROLL button. ^g06

// TURN 3, COUNSELOR'S REPORT: LOYALTY REPORT
STR_BASIC_071							^g00:009,341,622,091   This time in the counselors' reports, let's examine the Loyalty Report. This large graph has the names of all kingdoms in Anuire listed both across the top and down the left side. If there are any kingdoms that have been completely conquered, their names will have black lines through them. ^g05
STR_BASIC_072							^g00:009,341,622,091   You'll notice that Dhoesone has a red line down both lengths of the graph to make it easier to read. At each intersection of the graph, each kingdom that is not neutral to the other named kingdom will have a colored symbol shown. The legend at the bottom illustrates the meaning of the colors: enemies are orange, permissive allies are green, full allies are blue, and vassals are purple. ^g05
STR_BASIC_073							^g00:009,341,622,091   In addition, if the status has changed for any reason during the last turn, the color will be shown either as an up or down arrow. Note that in Dhoesone's column, Cariele still shows as neutral to us. Since they have raided one of our border forts, this neutrality will soon change as we take retribution. If no loyalty change has occurred this round, the relationship is shown as a colored square.

// TURN 3, DOMAIN ACTION 1: DECLARE WAR
STR_BASIC_081							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,162I think the time has come to declare war on Cariele, then invade them to insure that we have no more trouble from that direction. Unless a kingdom is allied with us, we have declared war on them this turn, or we already occupy the province, we cannot march troops in. ^g12^g05
STR_BASIC_082							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,162A declaration of war can only be made as the first or second, never the third, action of a turn. Since this is our first action of the round, let's declare war now.\n   Click on^C064 DECLARE WAR^C000. The list of possible realms to attack will be shown. Select Cariele, then DONE. ^g13:006^g06

// TURN 3, FREE ACTION AND DOMAIN ACTION 2: MUSTER TROOPS, BATTLE, & HOLD
STR_BASIC_091							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,162Now we need to use a free action to muster troops for our coming invasion of Cariele. Select^C064 MUSTER ARMIES^C000, then gather troops in Tradebhein and Ruidewash. ^g12^g13:015^g01:049,408
STR_BASIC_092							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,162March the new recruits, along with those forces already in Sonnelind, into Tradebhein. Answer YES when questioned whether the troops should join forces.\n   To begin the invasion, march the troops from Tradebhein into Cariele's adjacent province, Riverford. ^g12^g05
STR_BASIC_093							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,162Let's HOLD our second action to begin the battle. When asked if we wish to command the upcoming battle, answer YES again. Our wizards will automatically memorize all their battle spells so that they will be ready for use in the battle. ^g13:011^g01:049,296

// TURN 3, DOMAIN ACTION 3:
STR_BASIC_101							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Well, my liege, I seem to have urged you out of my depth. While I am an able steward during times of peace, I really don't know how to run a war. I think it is time that you took over.\n   Be sure to read the rest of your advisers' reports at the end of each season. Continue building your forces, strengthening your defenses, and attacking our foes in Cariele. And, when you feel you have learned enough, then you should begin ruling your own realm. Fhiele Dhoesone will return when she must. Good fortune, my liege. It was a privilege to have served you. ^g06
STR_BASIC_102							^g13:001^g13:006^g13:007^g13:011^g13:013^g13:015^g40

// ADVANCED GAME TUTORIAL, INTRO
STR_BASIC_111							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Welcome back, my liege. I presume you have already completed the instruction on the Basic Game features. If not, please start with that course of training before continuing here. The instruction I will provide now builds upon that earlier training.\n   Picking up where we left off, we had already covered instruction in adventures, wars, diplomacy, recruiting lieutenants, mustering troops, and passing. Now, we will add the economic side of running a realm in Anuire. ^g20^g05

// TURN 4, ADMIN PHASE: INTRODUCE TAXES AND REGENCY
STR_BASIC_112							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264We have added a new screen to your domain turn. This is the administrative phase, where you can control revenue and expenditures of your realm. Every three months (at the beginning of each turn), your kingdom will provide you with resources called Regency and Treasury. Regency is a measure of political power. Treasury provides gold bars. As you have already seen, both are necessary for the running of the realm and should not be squandered. ^g10^g05
STR_BASIC_113							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Let's begin our explanation of this aspect of your realm by setting your tax rates. Click on the^C064 TAX LEVELS^C000 control. At the top of the TAXATION screen, you'll notice that the chart shows UNUSED REGENCY from the last turn. Added to this number is your current DOMAIN POWER, a figure which is based upon our kingdom's strength and will change over time. Immediately below DOMAIN POWER is your BLOODLINE STRENGTH, a measure of your personal power. ^g10^g11:000^g01:049,388^g05
STR_BASIC_114							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Every three months (at the beginning of each turn), you will receive the smaller of the current domain power or your bloodline strength in additional regency. Because you have such a strong bloodline, that number is currently the larger of the two, so it is dimmed. The total of unused regency plus the smaller number equals your NEW REGENCY. ^g05
STR_BASIC_115							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264If you had a much weaker bloodline, you might want to press the '+' next to BLOODLINE STRENGTH. For a regency cost of your current bloodline plus one, you can permanently increase your bloodline strength by one. For you, the cost would be 47 regency. At the rate of receiving one extra regency per turn (assuming it was smaller than your domain power), it would take 47 turns to recoup.\n   Below NEW REGENCY, the number of gold bars in your treasury from the previous season is shown. Below that is a summary of your current income and expenses which total to NEW TREASURY at the bottom. ^g05
STR_BASIC_116							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264The income portion of the chart shows the tentative amount of tax that can be collected from each listed province. If you adjust the tax levels for different provinces, you will see how a more severe tax level yields greater income, but without enough law holdings to control the province, you're in danger of driving it into rebellion. If a province does go into rebellion, no taxes can be collected. ^g05
STR_BASIC_117							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264The TAXATION scroll also has a column for LAW CLAIMS. A law claim allows you to attempt to take moneys generated by the holdings of others within your kingdom. If you do so, of course, they will be unhappy with you. Since how law claims work is quite complicated, let's ignore them for now. Later, when you have more experience, you can look them up in the on-line help. ^g05
STR_BASIC_118							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Once you have set the tax levels so that taxes are maximized without jeopardizing loyalty, click on the^C064 COLLECT TAXES^C000 control. The actual amount of taxes collected varies from season to season, but should average near the numbers indicated. When your taxes have been totaled, click on the ^C064REALM ACTIONS^C000 button to continue. ^g10^g11:005^g01:145,434

// TURN 4, DOMAIN ACTION 1 - BUILD A GUILD
STR_BASIC_121							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264As you can see, we have added 4 new domain actions dealing with the financial side of your realm. If you are to achieve your birthright, we must build up Dhoesone's economy. We have little income from trade because the two major guilds in Dhoesone are owned by the vile thieves currently ruling Cariele. As long as they control our trade, we are not masters of our own kingdom. We must build our own guild holdings. To begin, click on the ^C064CREATE HOLDING^C000 control. ^g12^g13:005^g01:049,150
STR_BASIC_122							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264While we can build in any realm in Anuire, for now let's just work within the borders of Dhoesone. Click on Dhoesone as the realm to build in. When choosing the province in which to build, you should pick one that is civilized enough to sustain a large guild. The numbers beneath the province name on the map indicate its civilization level (the first number) and magic level (2nd number). ^g05
STR_BASIC_123							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264I would suggest building in a province with at least a level 3 civilization which can sustain a 3rd level guild. The higher the guild level, the more trade routes it can manage, and the more money it can generate for us.\n  Our northern provinces can only support a level 1 or 2 guild holding. Our coastal province of Nolien, though, has level 3 civilization as well as a road. For now, let's choose Nolien to build in. ^g05
STR_BASIC_124							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264After selecting the province to build in, click on GUILD as the type of holding to create. You will note the Success number or probability of successfully accomplishing our current project. If we are not willing to accept these odds, we can expend our political power, or regency, to improve them. ^g05
STR_BASIC_125							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Click on the '+' button to expend regency and improve the probability of success. If you roll and fail, the regency and gold you spent will be lost. If you spend enough regency to increase the odds to 100 percent, you will always succeed. The total cost in gold and regency appears below. When you are ready, click on the ROLL button. You have now created a level 0 guild hall. Later, you can raise its level with the RULE realm action to make it more useful. When you have seen your results, press DONE.

// TURN 4, FREE ACTION - BUILD A ROAD
STR_BASIC_131							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Let's do one of your free actions this time. We'll build a road so that we can put our traders to work. We can only build roads in our own kingdom or into neighboring provinces of friendly countries. Dhoesone has many existing roads within its boundaries, but let's build another one, from Nolien to Tradebhein so that we can create a trade route there. More on that later. ^g12^g05
STR_BASIC_132							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264When you click on the button for^C064 BUILD ROAD^C000, the scroll will give you a list of provinces to start the road in. Once we click on the starting province of Nolien, a list will appear to its right showing possible ending provinces. Notice that because there's already a road from Nolien to Sonnelind, Sonnelind does not show up as a possible destination for our new road. ^g13:003^g01:049,109
STR_BASIC_133							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Once we click on Tradebhein as the ending province, a message will appear at the bottom of the scroll showing how much the road will cost. The cost is based on the type of terrain through which the road passes. Building through plains is the least expensive, while roads through forests or mountains cost much more. ^g05
STR_BASIC_134							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Click on BUILD to actually build the road. If we wanted to, we could select another beginning province and build additional roads. For now, just click the DONE button. ^g05

// TURN 4, DOMAIN ACTION 2: ESTABLISH TRADE ROUTE
STR_BASIC_135							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Now that we have a road leading to our new guild hall in Nolien, let's make some money from it. We need to establish a trade route. This requires a guild hall at the beginning of a road to another province of a different terrain type. You can determine the dominant terrain type of any province by right-clicking within its borders. Trade between plains and forests, for instance, would be profitable, where plains to plains would not. Let's use our new road to Tradebhein. Left-click on the^C064 CREATE TRADE ROUTE^C000 control. ^g12^g13:018^g01:049,437
STR_BASIC_136							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264As only Nolien has a guild we own, we must click upon it as the start of our trade route. We have six choices of destination for our trade route. Let's choose Tradebhein and use our new road. After you have selected them, use regency to increase your Success level to 100 percent so that you cannot fail. At other times, you may not wish to expend so much regency for every action you take, but, for now, the cost is justified. ^g05
STR_BASIC_137							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264When you complete a new trade route, it will appear on the map in Dhoesone's colors. Trade routes are considered part of the guilder's holdings, though. To see them on the map, be sure to have guild holdings enabled.\n   When you have the probability at 100 percent, press ROLL, then DONE. ^g01:514,440

// TURN 4, DOMAIN ACTION 3: RULE
STR_BASIC_141							^g02:390,064^g00:422,116,200,264If you ever wish to see just those holdings belonging to any one realm or organization, you can use the^C064 FIGHTING UNITS AND HOLDINGS^C000 button to bring up a list of realms and others that own sources, guilds, temples, or law holdings. If you use the TURN ALL OFF select boxes at the bottom of the lists to disable everyone's domains, you can then turn on any one realm or organization, one at a time, to see just their holdings. ^g12^g01:448,442^g05
STR_BASIC_142							^g02:390,064^g00:422,116,200,264Try this now with Dhoesone and Upper Anuire Traders. Be sure to enable the display of guild holdings to see which ones Upper Anuire Traders own. You may have to zoom the map out some to see all their guilds. In addition to their extensive holdings in Boeruine, Thurazor, and Mhoried, they also own a holding in Dhoesone, in the province of Soniele. When you're done, clear the FIGHTING UNITS AND HOLDINGS list by clicking on its button again. ^g05
STR_BASIC_143							^g02:390,064^g00:422,116,200,264Today, we will consider the benefits of Ruling your properties. Ruling will allow you to increase the civilization level of your provinces or the level of your holdings up to their maximum possible. You can only increase the level of a given province or holding once per action, but as many individuals as you choose can be ruled together. Press the ^C064RULE^C000 control now.  ^g13:017^g01:049,392^g05
STR_BASIC_144							^g02:390,064^g00:422,116,200,264Note that Dhoesone has enough holdings to more than fill one page of the Rule scroll. Use the NEXT PAGE and PREV. PAGE buttons to see the entire list.\n   Now might be a good time to explain the relationship between civilization level and magic level. As a province becomes more civilized, there is less access to the magical sources of nature. This means that if you successfully rule a province level, the civilization level goes up one, and the province's magic level goes down one. The level of  magic, however, does not decrease below zero. ^g05
STR_BASIC_145							^g02:390,064^g00:422,116,200,264Let's increase the level of some of our law holdings so that we can increase the taxes in those provinces without causing the residents to rebel. Both Bjondrig and Romiene have current law holding levels of 0. To be sure we succeed, let's again spend the regency required to increase the success probability to 100 percent. ^g05
STR_BASIC_146							^g02:390,064^g00:422,116,200,264You may notice that the law holding in Soniele is also level 0, but that we do not have the option of ruling it. This is because there is a law holding in Soniele owned by Upper Anuire Traders, using up all of the civilization of that province.\n   Once both success rolls are ready, press ROLL, then, after viewing the results, click on DONE. 

// TURN 4, COUNSELOR'S REPORT: SEE ALLIANCE REPORT 
STR_BASIC_151							^g00:009,341,622,091   As always, you can view any of the counselor's reports that you wish. This time, though, let's review the Alliances report. This document details those realms that you have alliances with. It also lists the major alliances throughout Anuire. Those kingdoms that have the most allies will be listed. ^g05
STR_BASIC_152							^g00:009,341,622,091   Those realms in this report are the ones that are also on the road to the Iron Throne. As such, they may either be our best opportunities for improving our own position (if we can gain their allegiance), or they could be our most powerful foes. Declaring war on a realm will cause its allies to fight us as well, so realms with many allies can be formidable obstacles to our plans.^g05
STR_BASIC_153							^g00:009,341,622,091   Let's also take a look at the Troop Report. This report shows which realms are militarily active in Anuire at this time. We are listed at the top as usual, while the 10 realms with the most military might appear below. As with the Alliances report, these realms are likely to be our strongest allies or most dangerous foes. Remember them well, my liege. We should seek alliance with the strongest and be on our guard against them all. It is they that can stand between you and the Iron Throne. ^g06

// TURN 5, ADMINISTRATIVE PHASE - PAYROLL
STR_BASIC_161							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Any time that you get to the administration screen and realize that you wish you'd examined more of the counselors' reports, you can go back and do so by selecting^C064 DO REPORT^C000. This button takes you back to the counselors' screen from which you can study as many reports as you'd like. Once you have finished, click DONE to return to the administration screen. ^g10^g11:004^g05
STR_BASIC_162							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264When gold gets short and troops are not needed for current activities, it might be best to disband some units or find alternate ways to insure their continued support. Let's look at the options you have for paying troops. Press the ^C064PAYROLL^C000 control now. All troops under your command are listed, with their location, and the cost of maintaining each. The total cost of all your troops is a constant drain on the treasury, but you can choose to save gold by using your regency or political power to keep the troops loyal. Change one of your troops from payment with gold to payment with regency now. ^g10^g11:002^g01:145,388^g05
STR_BASIC_163							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264You may wish to disband a troop instead of paying it. In that case, turn off its payment checkbox by clicking on it. The troop name turns red, indicating that it will disband. The net effect on your treasury should be obvious. Since we can always muster more troops when we have need of them, it is sometimes best to disband those that are not needed now. But, it costs more to muster than to maintain, so we might want to keep enough around for defense at all times. Also, disbanded mercenaries become bandits, so it is best to disband non-mercenary troops only. ^g05
STR_BASIC_164							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264When you click on the^C064 MAINTENANCE^C000 button, a list of all provinces you own or have holdings in will be displayed. The color that the province name appears in shows its status. Names in blue are true-blue or totally loyal. Green ones have an average loyalty level, orange names have poor loyalty, and red ones are in active rebellion. Gray names are provinces that you have holdings in but do not own. ^g10^g11:003^g01:049,434^g05
STR_BASIC_165							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264 The Maintenance Report displays the costs and income from each holding that you own. Below that, you'll see that the rest of the chart nicely summarizes your other income and expenses.\n   Below Tax Collected, the first item listed is Other Income. This is your trade route income. Next listed is the deduction for Payroll which summarizes the PAYROLL REPORT. ^g05
STR_BASIC_166							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264The cost of your castles appears next, with a line drawn from the column where this information originates. This item is the cost of maintaining your strongholds.\n   The cost of your Provinces and Holdings is listed next. The number of gold bars subtracted is the administrative cost to maintain them. This cost is calculated based on the total number of provinces and holdings you own and generally is less than the taxes you are receiving from them. ^g05
STR_BASIC_167							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Next is tribute and salaries which are any regular payments that you may have agreed during diplomacy to pay. It's a good idea to keep an eye on this number. You can easily bankrupt your treasury by promising more than you can sustain over time. The last item before New Treasury is Court, a level which affects the outcome of diplomatic actions. The higher your court expenditure, the better you will do in diplomacy. With zero court expenditure, you cannot initiate diplomacy. ^g10^g11:005^g05
STR_BASIC_168							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264When you are finished harassing the troops, roll for your taxes and click on the DOMAIN ACTIONS control to continue. ^g10^g11:005^g01:145,434

// WE DONE. SAY GOODBYE.
STR_BASIC_171							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Well, my liege. I have completed the introduction to the economic elements of running a realm. You can either spend a few rounds experimenting with your new command options, or return to your own realm at this time. Good luck, my liege, and farewell. ^g06
STR_BASIC_172							^g13:001^g13:003^g13:005^g13:006^g13:007^g13:0011 ^g13:013^g13:015^g13:017^g13:018^g40

// EXPERT GAME TUTORIAL, INTRO
STR_BASIC_181							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Ah, you've come again, my liege. I presume you have already completed the instruction for the Basic and Advanced Game features. If not, please complete those training sessions before continuing here. The instruction I will provide now builds upon that earlier training.\n   Picking up where we left off, we had already covered instruction in adventuring, wars, diplomacy, recruiting lieutenants, mustering troops, passing, trade routes, ruling, creating holdings, and building roads. Now, we will add the most advanced actions involved in running a realm. ^g20^g05

// TURN 6, ADMIN PHASE: OCCUPIED TERRITORIES BUTTON
STR_BASIC_182							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Let's begin with the Occupation Report. Click^C064 OCCUPATION^C000. The Occupation Report lists all of our provinces, each with an empty check box headed Occupy Own. You can occupy any of your provinces, but without a substantial number of troops in the province, you risk rebellion. Law holdings have no effect here. Occupying your province is basically equivalent to declaring martial law and gives you rights that a conqueror would receive. Occupying your province will reduce its loyalty level by one. ^g10^g11:001^g01:097,388^g05
STR_BASIC_183							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264If you click in the Occupy Own box for a province, two additional check boxes, Reduce Foreign Holdings and Pillage Province also display. Clicking in Reduce Foreign Holdings will, over the course of a turn, reduce the level of all foreign holdings within the province to 0. (To then destroy the holdings, you will have to Contest them - one of your new domain actions. But, since they will be level 0 holdings, only one, not two, successful contests will be required.) ^g10^g05
STR_BASIC_184							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Pillage Province acts essentially as an additional severe taxation upon a province, but at a cost both of reducing the province's civilization level by 1 and further reducing its loyalty level by 1. To raise the maximum amount of gold bars from a province, you would first set your taxation level at severe, collect your taxes, then set pillage the province. The loot column at the right tells you how many additional gold bars you will receive. ^g05
STR_BASIC_185							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264For foreign, non-aligned provinces in which you have troops at the end of a turn, if you have at least as many troops as the civilization level of the province (so that it will not go into rebellion), the province will then be classified as occupied. You can collect taxation, but not regency, from occupied foreign provinces. In addition, you can choose to either Reduce Foreign Holdings or Pillage Province (or both) in the same manner as you can your own provinces. ^g05
STR_BASIC_186							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Roll for taxes now. Since occupation has no effect on your taxes, you can continue to change your occupation choices after rolling for taxes, adjusting your choices until you end the administrative phase and move on to your other Domain Actions. When you're ready, click the ^C064DOMAIN ACTIONS^C000 control to go on. ^g10^g11:005^g01:145,434

// TURN 6, LIEUTENANT ACTION: DISPEL REALM MAGIC
STR_BASIC_191							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,162As you can see, we have added 8 more realm actions that you can use. We'll go through the new ones one at a time. First, though, I see that a blight has affected our province of Nolien. We could ignore the blight until it clears on its own, or we could ask your lieutenant, Clumine Dhoesone, to use his magic to dispel it. ^g12^g05
STR_BASIC_192							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264To have your lieutenant act for you is a special kind of free action. Only one Lieutenant Action is available per turn. When the lieutenant does act on your behalf, he is not authorized to spend additional regency.\n   When you click the^C064 LIEUTENANT ACTION^C000 control, a list of your available lieutenants will display. Choose Clumine Dhoesone, then click DONE. ^g13:014^g01:097,348
STR_BASIC_193							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264The words Lieutenant Action will now appear at the top of the action buttons. Some of the Domain Actions can only be performed by the regent. Actions available to lieutenants are Adventure (if a lieutenant leads the action, the regent cannot go), Agitate, Contest, Create Holding, Diplomacy, Espionage, Build Ley Line (if the lieutenant is a wizard), Fortify, Realm Spell (if the lieutenant is a wizard or priest), Rule, and Trade Route. At this point, if you press an action key, then press CANCEL to undo, it will cancel both the incorrect selection and the Lieutenant Action. ^g05
STR_BASIC_194							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264This time let's select^C064 REALM SPELL^C000. In the case of a wizard, a list of the realms where we have sources will display. (A priest must have temples in order to cast a realm spell.) Choose Dhoesone; now a list of the provinces within our realm which have sources, along with the source's level, will appear. Press Nolien. ^g12^g13:016^g01:097,396^g05
STR_BASIC_195							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264The province's name and source level will be displayed, along with a list of realm spells the wizard knows and the source level each requires. Click on DISPEL REALM MAGIC. Different spells may allow you to affect neighboring provinces or vary the strength, as this spell does. Let's change the desired Strength to 1, then click DONE. ^g12^g05

// //////////// - Resequencing of realm actions done here so that agitate comes just before investiture. RC

// TURN 6, DOMAIN ACTION 1: CONTEST

STR_BASIC_196							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Since the lieutenant action did not use up one of our domain actions, we can now conduct our first regular domain action for this round. If you look around the map of Dhoesone, you'll see that Cariele (brown and green shield) has quite a number of holdings in our kingdom. Where they have holdings, it uses up the slots that are available for us and allows them to influence our actions in those provinces. To reduce Cariele's influence, let's contest their guild in Sonnelind so that Cariele cannot gain regency or gold from it. Click the^C064 CONTEST^C000 control now. ^g12^g13:004^g01:097,118
STR_BASIC_197							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Select the province of Sonnelind. Choose Cariele's guild from the list of holdings, and spend regency to increase our required success probability to 100 percent. Press ROLL. You'll see that when you contest the holding of another realm, they may in turn spend their regency to lower our success number. Since Cariele has a vested interest in maintaining its holdings, they might choose to oppose our action. ^g05
STR_BASIC_198							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264At this point we could CANCEL if we feel that to proceed is too expensive, but in this case, let's spend more regency and increase the success probability back to 100 percent. Press ROLL. After reading the results, press DONE.\n   Cariele's shield on the lower left of their guild will now have an X across it, indicating that it has been successfully contested. Not surprisingly, our contesting their holding will make Cariele like us even less than they used to as it now produces less revenue than before. Successfully contesting it again would destroy it.

// TURN 6, DOMAIN ACTION 2: FORTIFY 
STR_BASIC_201							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264The action^C064 FORTIFY^C000 allows you to build or improve your provinces' castles to better defend the provinces they are in. Each province may have only one castle, its maximum level equal to the civilization level of the province. A castle forces invading armies to leave behind units equal to the level of the castle in order to besiege it. Since we are actively provoking Cariele, we should fortify our defenses before they mount an invasion. Select^C064 FORTIFY^C000 now. ^g12^g13:010^g01:097,256
STR_BASIC_202							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264A list of our provinces with any existing castles will display. Let's begin a level 2 castle in our perimeter province of Tradebhein. Set the desired level of castle to build by pressing the '+' key. The building cost in gold bars for this turn will be shown. Any number of castles may be begun or improved in one action. ^g05
STR_BASIC_203							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Each turn until construction is completed, a six-sided dice will be rolled to determine progress. Whenever the total of the die rolls reaches 8, the castle will increase one level until the desired level has been reached. Each new castle that we place in one of our provinces improves our defenses. With our war with Cariele heating up, a few fortifications would be prudent. When you're ready, click DONE to continue.

// TURN 6, DOMAIN ACTION 3: AGITATE

STR_BASIC_211							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Let's now take a look at the ^C064AGITATE^C000 domain action. This one allows you to raise or lower the loyalty level of the populace in any province you have a law holding in. We could use this to improve the loyalty of one of our provinces so that we can either raise taxes without triggering a revolt or suppress a rebellion that has made a province contested (producing no income). ^g05 
STR_BASIC_212							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Agitation can also be used as a weapon. Declaring war on Cariele and attacking them has earned us their everlasting hatred. We must finish them now or fight them forever. To weaken them before we attack in full force, we'll send agents into their remaining provinces to agitate the populace, lower their loyalty, and take tax moneys away from Cariele. Since agitation can be performed on multiple provinces at the same time, we can do both of these at once. ^g05
STR_BASIC_213							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264When you click upon the ^C064AGITATE^C000 control, you will see a list of provinces in which you have law holdings. You can select one of your own provinces to agitate to a higher loyalty level, or you can select a province of an enemy that we would like to agitate to a lower loyalty level (not Riverford, which we occupy), or both. In each case, we can use both gold and regency to improve our chances. Do that now and click ROLL to see where you succeed, then DONE. ^g13:002^g04:097,102

// COUNCELOR SCREEN, TURN 7				
STR_BASIC_221							^g00:009,341,622,091   There are no new reports to introduce at this time, so let's just hit the DONE button and move on. 							

// ADMIN PHASE, TURN 7
STR_BASIC_231							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264We have covered all that you need to know at the administrative phase. So, adjust your payments and tax levels as you wish and roll for taxes. Then select ^C064DOMAIN ACTIONS^C000 to continue. ^g11:000^g11:001^g11:002^g11:003^g11:004^g11:005

// TURN 7, FREE ACTION AND DOMAIN ACTION 1: MUSTER TROOPS AND INVEST
STR_BASIC_241							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Back during your Basic training, we began the invasion of Cariele by attacking in Riverford. Well, that campaign has been successful, and we now have the only troops in that province. But, we don't own it yet. To fully take over Riverford, we must Invest it, transferring the ties of that province from the regent of Cariele to the regent of Dhoesone. Before we can invest, we must have enough troops on hand to besiege any castles and put down any rebellions. ^g12^g21:973,350^g05 
STR_BASIC_242							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Anytime you invade another realm, you will find that the local populace does not necessarily welcome you with open arms. The good folk of Riverford in Cariele will go into open revolt unless the garrison that we left included at least as many troops as the civilization level of that province. If they are in revolt, we must move more troops in to keep order so that we can invest the province and fully take over. In Riverford, therefore, we will need 5 troops to maintain order. ^g12^g13:015^g01:049,388^g05
STR_BASIC_243							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264First, we should muster new troops in our southern provinces. We can only muster as many troops as the civilization level of each province, so we can muster 2 in Sidhuire and 2 in Tradebhein. That should be more than enough for our immediate plans. It's better not to muster too many as the expense to maintain them could break our treasury. Once the troops have been raised, move them to our front in Riverford. There, they can both quell the rebellious populace and be in position for further moves against Cariele when we are ready. ^g05
STR_BASIC_244							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Notice that we can move our troops from Sidhuire through the lands of our ally Tuarhievel. Similarly, we can move our Tradebhein troops through Thurazor. Allies not only provide a buffer against attack, they also permit free movement of our troops through their realms. ^g06
STR_BASIC_245							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264The preparations are done. We have invaded Cariele. We have conquered the province of Riverford. We have controlled the rebellious populace. We are ready to transfer ownership of this province to Dhoesone with a spell of investiture. ^g05
STR_BASIC_246							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264To do the investiture, click the^C064 INVESTITURE^C000 control and select the province we are ready to invest. At this time, only Riverford is available. Then, we need only expend the regency necessary to insure success and click the ROLL button. Once the investiture is complete, notice how the map is updated to reflect our new border. ^g13:012^g01:097,302

// TURN 7, DOMAIN ACTION 2: ESPIONAGE 1 AND 2
STR_BASIC_251							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264The thieves of Cariele continue to bedevil us. It is time to teach them the price of sparring with mighty Dhoesone. Let me introduce you to your spy network and its capabilities, my liege. First, we must find Cariele's regent. Check the map and look for force icons belonging to Cariele, most likely in their remaining provinces. Right click on each until you find their regent, Entier Gladanil. Note the province that he is in. Now, click the^C064 ESPIONAGE^C000 control and select Cariele as our target. ^g12^g13:008^g01:097,210
STR_BASIC_252							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264As a guild master (thief) yourself, you can arrange for one espionage action as a free action per turn. Priest regents can do a free agitate action. Let's do our free espionage action first. Your spies can be used either to gain intelligence about your enemies or to arrange for assassination attempts. Let's continue our campaign against Cariele with an assassination attempt on Entier Gladanil, the weak willed fop that has allowed Cariele's guilds to plague us for so long. ^g05
STR_BASIC_253							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264After specifying Entier as our target, we must try to locate a competent assassin. Using regency to improve our chances, click on ROLL when you are ready. If you succeed in finding an assassin, he is sent on his mission, then must engage in combat with his intended victim. Failure may occur here as well. But, if he succeeds, Cariele will be weakened considerably, losing all their accumulated regency. Another leader will step forward next season, but for now, they will be leaderless and weak. ^g05
STR_BASIC_254							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Well, that was worthwhile. With assassins pursuing their leaders, the Carielians now know we are serious. We should use our assassination squads for another mission. In addition to hunting for individuals, they can be sent to poison the wells of an entire troop. Let's use our next domain action to take out one of their elite forces. Select^C064 ESPIONAGE^C000 again. 
STR_BASIC_255							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264We'll use exactly the same procedure we used against Entier. Select the target realm and province, then pick a unit of troops, rather than any individual, as the target. The assassin is hired and sent in. He may have to fight past guards to complete his mission, so he may fail. If not, though, an entire unit of enemy troops will be destroyed.

// TURN 7, LIEUTENANT ACTION AND DOMAIN ACTION 3: FORGE LEY LINE & HOLD
STR_BASIC_261							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Now that we've taken over Cariele's capital province, let's start harassing them elsewhere so we can continue the conquest. You'll notice that we already have a level 0 source in Mhelliviene. No realm spells can work with only a level 0 source. We could take several turns to rule the source holding, or we can take a shortcut and forge a ley line. ^g12^g05
STR_BASIC_262							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Ley lines connect sources, regardless of the separation of the provinces in which they are located. Note that ley lines can be built like roads, linking an entire series of sources. The cost of forging a ley line is based on the number of provinces that are traversed. One gold bar and one regency point are paid for each province crossed. ^g05
STR_BASIC_263							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264When a ley line is in place and a wizard is casting a realm spell, the lowest source in the line gets credit for having a source holding equal to the highest to which it is connected. For example, if we connect the source in Mhelliviene to our level 5 source in Tradebhein, both effectively become level 5 sources for realm spell casting. ^g05
STR_BASIC_264							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264If you yourself were a wizard, you could build ley lines during any action. However, since your skills lie in other areas, we must use a Lieutenant Action to build a ley line. Any level wizard is able to forge them. First select Lieutenant Action, then Clumine Dhoesone. ^g13:014^g01:097,348
STR_BASIC_265							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Now to have him build the ley line, select^C064 FORGE LEY LINE^C000. A list of provinces in which we have sources will be displayed. Since Tradebhein has our closest level 5 source to Cariele, choose it as the starting province. Then eligible end provinces will display. Choose Mhelliviene, then ROLL, then DONE. ^g12^g13:009^g01:049,256
STR_BASIC_266							^g02:390,104^g00:422,136,200,264Now that we have a source in Mhelliviene, we can use it to cast offensive realm magics against Cariele in that province. But, since Clumine does not have any such spells yet, that will have to wait until we recruit more powerful magical assistants. For now, therefore, just do a ^C064HOLD^C000 action. ^g12^g13:011^g01:049,302

// COUNCILOR SCREEN, TURN 8
STR_BASIC_271							^g00:009,341,622,091   We have a new report to introduce now - Investitures. It will show the province that we have taken from Cariele this round. As the campaigns of all the regents of Anuire progress, this report will show those that are succeeding in the pursuit of the Iron Throne. Watch it closely in the future. More assistance can be found by discussions with the historians in the Game Manual and On-Line Help.  Talk with them about the History of Anuire and Approaches to Winning the Empire. ^g05

STR_BASIC_272							^g05^g00:009,341,622,091   We have introduced each of the counselor reports except the War Report which simply shows the status of any wars that were declared during the previous turn. As we did not renew our war declaration with Cariele this turn, it will not show on the report. All the wars in Anuire will be listed here, when you care to look. ^g05

STR_BASIC_273							^g00:009,341,622,091   Congratulations, Regent! You have now learned all of the basics for running Dhoesone. If I were regent, I would complete the conquest of Cariele, thus proving you are worthy both of kingship and are a suitable candidate for your ultimate goal of the Iron Throne itself. Of course, though, I am not a regent, merely your humble adviser. You will have to make the decisions now that will determine your destiny. Are you ready to claim your Birthright? ^g06

STR_GMMAP_NO_GOLD				^F02^a031^W310   My Liege, the realm's finances are insufficient to cover its expenses. You must go BACK and disband some or all of your troops, cease maintaining your castles, or reduce your court level.\n   If you have done all this, you have no choice but to ACCEPT the consequences: you will be unable to meet your tribute obligations. Sadly, those regents who do not receive the full measure of tribute will become quite angry, perhaps even to the point of war.
