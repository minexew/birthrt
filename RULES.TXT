^F02 
^#032Three Types of Game
^F02 
     Realm Expansion, Wars and Battles, and Adventures are the three ways to play Birthright and to collect enough points to save Anuire from the Gorgon and his allies. First, you must select a realm6 to rule and a regent to lead it. After you select the Begin Rule button from the regent screen, your first domain turn begins.
^F02 
^#038Realm
^F02 
     A Realm is a domain that contains one or more provinces. Domains control no territory, only holdings, and are made up of high level non-player characters and their temple, source, or guild networks.
^F02 
^#033The Domain Turn
^F02 
     Each domain turn is the equivalent of three months of game time and consists of three domain actions, i.e. one Domain Turn = three Domain Actions = three Months of Game Time. Therefore, each domain action equals one month of game time.
     For example, if you select the domain action Adventure, it lasts one month of game time. Three such adventures would take three domain actions and complete a three-month domain turn. Realm Management and Reports are assumed to occur at the beginning of the first month of the Domain Turn.
     Every domain turn takes you through the following sequence of events:
     1.	Advisors' Reports.
       	On your first turn, your advisors report the current state of your realm. On following turns they show you information on the points you've acquired toward winning the game, holdings and assets, new adventure possibilities, alliances, wars, magical activities, information on diplomacy, and others.
     2.	Realm Management.	(Not available in Basic game)
     	After the advisors report, the Realm Maintenance Screen appears on the left and the Map of Anuire on the right. To manage your realm you must maintain your Provinces, Holdings, and Assets, such as roads, castles, and armies. On the Anuire map you can right-click on provinces, holdings, and assets for even more information. After setting and collecting your taxes the Domain Actions screen appears.
     3.	Domain Actions.
     	You must choose three Domain Actions to complete your domain turn. Domain Actions include expanding your realm, doing battle with other realms, and going Adventuring. Some domain actions are Free Actions and do not count towards the three needed to finish your turn. Your choice of domain actions determines how your realm grows. For example, adventures allow your character and lieutenants to find treasure, magic, and Relics of Power to strengthen your realm and your claim to the Iron Throne.
^F02 
^#034Winning the Game
^F02 
     As you play Birthright you amass points through diplomacy and alliances, battles and conquest, or the acquisition of Relics of Power while adventuring. In the Main Menu's Options screen you can choose how difficult you want winning the empire to be. Click on the Game Settings button and choose Easy, Medium, or Hard. You'll need 300, 400, or 500 points, respectively, to win the Iron Throne of Anuire. 
^F02 
ACTIONS				POINTS
Provinces that you own			3 per province 
Provinces of your vassals			3 per province
Full alliances				2 per province
Permissive alliances			1 per province
The Spiderfell province			10
The Province of Rhoubhe Manslayer	10
Provinces of Gorgon's Crown		10
Provinces of Awnsheghlien allies		5
     (Markazor, Mur-Kilad, Chimaeron, Thurazor, etc.)
Sword of Roele				60
Regalia of the Empire			30
State Crown of Anuire			30
Banner of Roele				20
Any other Relic of Power			10
Defeating the Gorgon in battle		100
^F02 
^#136After You Win...
^F02 
After acquiring enough points to win the game, you'll have two options:
     1.	Starting the game over at a different difficulty level or with a different regent character, or
     2.	Continuing to play and to build your empire in the current game.
     	If you continue as the new emperor, the game becomes very difficult as contenders try to take your place. Legends state that Rhoubhe Manslayer and the Gorgon can be defeated but not killed. These mighty foes may disappear but are merely gathering their strength before they attack once again. Beware!
^F02 
^#316Success Numbers
^F02 
     If you choose the Description Style AD&D(R) (ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS(R)) from the Main Menu, then Options, then Game Settings list, one of the numbers you'll see during the game is referred to as the Success Number. This number refers to the roll of a 20-sided dice and runs from one through 20. The lower this number, the better. A success number of one always succeeds, while a success number of 20 always fails.
^F02 
^#221     As a general rule, modifying a success roll with gold bars or regency improves your chances of success by 5% for each bar or point spent. For example, an unadjusted success number of ten gives you a 50% chance of success ((20-10 = 10) X 5% = 50%). Spending five regency points to adjust this lowers your success number to five, improving your percentage chance to 75% ((20-5 = 15) X 5% = 75%).
^F02 
     At times, other realms may add their own regency or gold to adjust or contest actions antagonistic to their realm. When this occurs an audio cue states, "Success modified by opponent." In this case, you are given a chance to readjust your success number with gold or regency. This cycle may occur several times until both realms have stopped modifying the number. You are always given the last chance to adjust this number.
^F02 
^#123Regency
^F02 
     Regency is the power a regent has to rule his realm and is generated by his provinces, holdings, and assets. Regency is limited by Bloodline Strength.
     Current regency is located in the top right corner of the Taxation, Occupation, Payroll, and Maintenance screens. Regency points are spent and used with gold to modify the success of most Domain Actions. Your army can be paid in regency instead of gold on the Payroll screen. You can spend regency to raise your Bloodline Strength. Unused regency is the regency left over from your last Domain Turn. New Regency is the sum of your unused regency points and either your bloodline strength or domain power, whichever is smaller.
     	See Domain Power and Bloodline Strength.

		During the Battles Only game, you can experiement with commanding troops on the battlefield as you learn the tactics and strategies of warfare.
		The Historical Background gives you an overview of the current situation in Anuire.
^F02 
^#284Tutorial Game
     There are three detailed tutorials to take you through the intricacies of realm management, adventures / personal combat with the occupants of those sites, and fighting wars on the battlefields with your troops. Each sequence of screens takes you step-by-step through the various tasks that are accessed by the buttons on the screen. These tasks include, but are not limited to, creating a holding, building roads, going on an adventure, moving your troops, etc. It is an absolute must for the new player, particularly those who are not familiar with "dungeons and dragons" games.
^F02 
Basic Tutorial
     In this tutorial, you'll learn about the realm map buttons that control the icons on the map of Anuire, moving your troops on the map, and the six domain action buttons available in the Basic Game. These include showing you the steps involved in mustering troops, the hold action, recruiting a lieutenant, going on an adventure, and fighting on the battlefield.
     Note:  How to conduct diplomacy, a part of the Basic game, is covered in the Advanced tutorial.
^F02 
Advanced Tutorial
     This picks up where the Basic tutorial ended and adds more domain actions to your game. Here you will learn how to create holdings, build roads, rule a province, and create a trade route, all of which expand your realm activities with economic controls.
^F02 
Expert Tutorial
     This last tutorial adds the remaining domain actions that are necessary for running a realm. These additional actions include learning to use realm spells, forging ley lines, conducting espionage, and having complete control over your realm.
^F02 
^#285Play Full Game
     First, you should choose the type of game that you wish to play based on your experience with the fantasy game genre. Click on each of the following choices for a brief description of each game. After you make your selection, the next step will be to choose a realm and a regent to role-play in your attempt to unite the Anuirean empire. 
^F02 
^#320Basic Game Play
     This choice of play uses six of the 18 maximum domain actions and emphasizes adventures and battles. Economic controls and other realm management decisions are handled automatically so that you do not have to build roads, create holdings, cast spells, etc. You should not assume that this is the "easiest" form of the game; it simply eliminates the details of realm management. The adventure sites and battles should provide the player with great challenges.
^F02 
^#321Advanced Game Play
     This choice of play increases the number of domain actions to ten. With these new actions, you have control over some of the economic and political decisions regarding your realm. For example, you can build roads, create holdings, create trade routes, and rule provinces. 
^F02 
^#322Expert Game Play
     This choice of play accesses the complete Birthright game with the full set of 18 domain actions. In addition to fighting wars and going on adventures, you have full realm management control over political and economic decisions.
^F02 
^#008      Choosing a Realm and Regent
     To select a realm, left-click on one of the named domains on the map. Information about that realm appears in the top, left corner and provides information about the current condition of the realm. It also furnishes hints for how best to play the realm. The kind of play you most enjoy should help you decide whether you want to rule a realm with a trade, magic, temple, or military emphasis. Easy, Medium, and Hard refer to how aggressive the neighboring realms are, the quantity of resources the selected realm possesses, and its alliances. It does NOT refer to the difficulty of the adventure sites in that realm. If you want to see another realm's information, click on a different named realm on the map.
^F02 
At the bottom, left of the screen are the two choices for that realm's regent. The regent's name is noted above each picture along with key information concerning the character's Race, Class, Level, Alignment, Bloodline Level, Bloodline, Bloodline Strength, and ancestry. Right-click on one of the pictures to get background information about that regent candidate.
^F02 
To view the character's Status and Inventory screens, left-click on the Character button. 
          Character Status Screen   (described below)
          Character Inventory Screen   (described below)
^F02 
     When you have decided on a realm and a regent, click the Begin Rule button associated with the regent you have selected. Whichever regent candidate you select, the alternate one becomes your regent's lieutenant.
^F02 
^F02 
^#318     Bloodline Level
     Bloodline levels are either tainted, minor, major or great. A character's bloodline level affects the range of bloodline strength.
   Bloodline Level	Bloodline Strength Range
	Tainted		4 - 16

     This form of the game consists of a sequence of eight adventures which allow you to practice your personal combat skills as you search through some of the adventure sites. The list of characters from which you choose your party is randomly determined. However, once you begin your series of adventures, this is your party for the duration of the game. When you complete all of the adventures, you win the adventurer's challenge.

^#140Character Statistics
^F02 
     There are six attributes which define the character's strengths and weaknesses. Character Statistics cannot go above 18 without magical aid.
     Strength:	A prime requisite statistic for fighters, rangers, and paladins. Strength above 16 can improve the damage you do in melee, improve your chance to hit an opponent, or both.
     Intelligence:	A prime requisite for wizards and bards. High intelligence improves a wizard's ability to learn spells and the number of spells he can know.
     Dexterity:	A prime requisite ability for thieves, bards, and rangers. Quick characters, those with high dexterity, avoid damage from sword and spell with greater success. Dexterity above 14 confers a bonus to Armor Class.
     Wisdom:	A prime requisite ability for priests, but also helps higher level rangers and paladins. High wisdom gives priests and paladins bonus spells and maximizes their chances of receiving spells from their patron deity.
     Constitution:	Provides characters with additional hit points, with fighters, rangers, and paladins receiving the most benefits. 
     Charisma:	A prime requisite for paladins and bards.
^F02 
^#012Regent Picture
^F02 
     To see a text description of the character, right-click on the regent's picture.
^F02 
^#044Alignment
^F02 
     The various alignments are lawful, good, neutral, and evil.
^F02 
     Your alignment in Birthright comes into play primarily when doing Diplomacy with other realms or non-player characters. Alignment translates loosely as the beliefs or tenets adhered to by your character. Good and Evil distinguish the value a character places on life, justice, and freedom. Law, Chaos, and Neutrality distinguish the type of government and ethics that the character believes in. For example, a Chaotic Evil character does not have much regard for life or cooperation and would receive a poor Diplomacy reaction from a Lawful Good character who believes in just government and protecting the weak.
^F02 
^#045Level
^F02 
     A character's level can be from one (1) through 29. The higher the class number, the better.
^F02 
     Your character's level affects both adventure and realm play, if your regent is a spellcaster. As the level of the character improves, so do Hit Points, THAC0, and the number and level of spells for the wizard and priest classes. Thus, picking a higher level regent and lieutenant is important if you are playing with an adventure emphasis. To go up in level you must accrue experience points. The number of experience points you need to go up in level becomes higher and harder to attain the longer you adventure.
 ^F02 
^#240Strength
^F02 
     Strength is the raw power of an individual and his/her ability to lift, carry, and smash things.
     How the strength level modifies your character:

^F02 
^#245Charisma
     Charisma is the character's natural ability to lead and influence people. This does not supersede blood level which rules realms.
^F02 
^#142THAC0 or Attack Skill
For AD&D Players
     THAC0 means "To Hit Armor Class 0." This is the minimum number on a 20-sided die necessary to hit an opponent with Armor Class 0 in melee combat. Strength, weapons, spells, and magic items can modify this chance to hit. Your THAC0 goes down, that is, improves your chance to hit, as your Level goes up. Fighters, Rangers, and Paladins improve their THAC0 faster per level than Priests, Thieves, or Wizards.
^F02 
For Simple Play
     In this mode of play, the term Attack Skill is used to denote your chance to hit a 50% armored individual.
^F02 
^#141Experience
     To go up in level your character must accumulate experience points in realm and adventure play. You receive experience points in realm play for domain actions. 
^F02 
     In adventures, experience is given individually to each character for killing creatures. Experience is given for gold, treasure, and magic items collected, as well as a large award for finding the quest object or Relics of Power. The amount of experience required to go up a level depends on the class and level of your character. The higher the level, the more experience points required to attain the next one. 
     See Realm Experience Points.and Adventure Experience Points.
^F02 
^#161Armor Class / Protection Level
For AD&D Players
     Armor Class is the term used for the relative protection your character has against melee attacks. Armor Class ranges from a ten, no armor, down to one, full plate armor, and can go as low as -10, only attainable by spells or magic. High Dexterity can improve, that is, lower, your Armor Class by up to four. Most spell effects are not affected by the Armor Class rating. A good low armor class helps you avoid taking melee damage in Adventures.
     The Armor your character wears determines his base Armor Class. Dexterity, Spells, or Magic Items can improve this base number. Your Regent's or Lieutenant's Armor cannot be replaced or taken off.
^F02 
For Simple Play
     This is the amount of protection your character is wearing compared to the maximum possible. It takes a lot of magic to go beyond 50%.
^F02 
^#162Hit Points
     Hit Points are the amount of damage your character can withstand before death occurs. Regents who wish to Adventure need as many hit points as possible. Curatives, with the exception of the Blood Ability Iron Will, can never raise your hit points above this number.
^F02 
     Current Hit Points reflect your character's health status after he has taken damage from sword, spell, or claw. Use of curative Spells and Magic Items can remove damage your character has taken. In Adventure play you can also see your character's current hit points on the colored health bar located on the character Adventure Status Bar. Clicking the Exit Adventure button completely restores all of your character's hit points.
^F02 
^#163Weapon
     This is the weapon your character wields in melee combat. The swords, axes, morning stars, and picks that the fighter and priest classes wield deal the most damage, while the daggers, staves, and smaller weapons of the thieves and wizards do the least. You would do well to keep the thieves and wizards at the back of the party while adventuring although you can be attacked from the rear. 
     Like armor, weapons cannot be replaced or dropped in Birthright.

Temple Holdings
^F02 
^#100     Temple holdings are monasteries, shrines, temples, and cathedrals of the character's faith. Naturally, they're vital to priest characters. The level of a temple holding reflects its share of worshipers in that province; a priest with a level 1 temple in a level 4 province has about 25% of the population attending his churches. Temple holdings can be controlled by any class of regent character, but only priests who control temple holdings can cast realm spells.
^F02 
     Regent priests and paladins collect one regency point for each level of each temple holding that they own. Temple holdings can be created by use of the domain action Create Holding and their level improved with the domain action Rule.
^F02 
^#011Race
^F02 
     Humans, dwarves, elves, and half-elves are the four races used for the 36 regents you have to choose from. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, the level a human can go up in each class is unlimited, but the demi-human races (dwarves, elves, and half-elves) are limited by a maximum level for each class. Only the demi-human races can be multiclassed. This gives them a greater selection of abilities, but because of this, they cannot gain experience or advance in level as quickly as the human characters.
^F02 
^#021Province Loyalty
^F02 
     The Loyalty of a province is indicated by the color of the province name.
     Red	=	a province in rebellion.
     Orange	=	a province with poor loyalty.
     Green	=	a province with average loyalty.
     Blue	=	a province with high loyalty.
     In the picture, the province names that are printed in green indicate a loyalty rating of average.
     A province's loyalty can be affected by the Tax Level set, whether or not it has a Law Holding, whether or not troops Occupy or Pillage there, the Agitate domain action, the realm spell Demagogue, and random events. At the end of the domain turn, the loyalty grade of the regent's provinces is adjusted as follows:
     -1 grade if severe taxes were collected.
+1 grade if light taxes were collected.
-1 grade if a rival regent successfully completed an agitate action.
+1 grade if the ruler successfully completes an agitate action.
-1 grade for a province under occupation. Note that a province assumes a loyalty of poor in the first turn that it is occupied by enemy forces.
^F02 
^#127     A regent who holds his lands in an iron grip can tolerate some discontent. Law Holdings control changes in loyalty as follows:
	A regent who controls all available law holdings in a province can ignore two grades of change in loyalty.
	A regent who controls at least half, but not all, of the available law holdings in a province can ignore one grade of change in loyalty.
	A regent who controls less than half of the law holdings in a province can't ignore any grades of loyalty change. Severe taxation causes a loss of one grade; normal taxation causes no change, while light taxation results in a gain of one loyalty grade. Law holdings prevent loyalty changes due to taxation or occupation of the province, but not due to any other factors listed in the earlier section of Province Loyalty.
^F02 
     Occupation forces:  Each company of soldiers occupying a province counts as one law holding for purposes of loyalty and taxation. Thus, occupying a level 4 province with four units of troops allows a regent to perform severe taxation without pushing the people into rebellion. When a province becomes rebellious, the ruling regent cannot collect any taxes there. See Occupation.
^F02 
^#019Province Levels
^F02 
     Your realm is made up of one or more provinces. The province level, the first number of the two that follow the province name, is an indicator of how developed each province is, in terms of the number of holdings and assets that the province can support. One regency point is collected for each level of each province in your realm. This is added to your Domain Power. The province level also determines the gold bars that are collected according to the tax level set, the type and number of troops available for Muster, and the maximum level of holdings and assets within each province. Your province level can be raised by using the domain action Rule and lowered by pillaging through Occupation.
^F02 
     In the Advanced tutorial, the first province in the list, Bjondrig, has a province level listing of one. Nolien, the fifth province in the list, has a province level of three. 
^F02 
^#043Bloodline
     Possible bloodlines are Anduiras, Azrai, Basaia, Brenna, Masela, Reynir, and Vorynn.
     Background concerning bloodline strength and ancestral derivation is detailed more thoroughly in the History and Atlas section of Birthrt.hlp. Bloodline affects realm play as your regency point score each turn is generated by your Domain Power (and vice-versa), up to the limit of your bloodline strength. By spending unused regency points equal to your bloodline strength plus one additional point, you can buy one point of bloodline strength. This may seem a high cost for one added regency point per turn, but as you play the game your domain power generally grows quickly greater than your bloodline. In a longer game, buying a bloodline point, and thus another regency point per turn, can be a smart, strategic investment. 
^F02 
^#046Class
^F02 
     When selecting a regent, it is important to choose a character class that best suits you and the type of play you enjoy. Possibilities include priest, fighter, thief, paladin, wizard, ranger, and bard.
     Hit Points are lowest for wizards and improve next for the thief, the priest and bard. Hit Points are highest for fighters, paladins, and rangers.
     Their THAC0 or chance "To Hit Armor Class 0" in melee, follows the same progression:  worst for wizards and thieves, best for priests and the warrior classes. 
Bards, wizards, priests, and rangers (8th+ level) and paladins (9th+ level) are the classes able to cast Spells. Only bards, wizards, and priests can cast the extremely powerful Realm Spells. This makes the bard, priest and wizard formidable foes in both Adventure and Battlefield combat as long as they avoid close combat.  The Agitate and Espionage actions can be done as Free Actions (one per turn) by priests and thieves respectively.
^F02 
^#018Source Level Potential
^F02 
     The original source level potential, the second number that follows the province name, is determined by the terrain type of that province. Do not confuse Source Level Potential with the actual Source Holding level created with the Create Holding domain action and improved by the domain action Rule. As the province civilization level goes up, the maximum potential source level goes down. This ultimately dictates the maximum level of your source holdings and what Realm Spells can be cast from that province. The actual source level for a province can be improved by the domain action Rule.
^F02 
     This table determines the potential source level of a province:
                      Terrain Type			Potential
                      Plains, Hills, and Marshes		5
                      Forests, Mountains, Rivers, Coasts	7
                      Swamps				8
                      Mountain, Deep Forests		9
In the tutorial for the Basic game, Bjondrig, the first province in the list, has a province source level potential of four. Nolien, the fifth province in the list, has a source level of two because the province level has been raised to three. Because the source level varies inversely with the province level, raising the province level three levels lowered the source level potential three places from its potential of five.

^#049     Game Settings
        Game	Birthright has three difficulty settings: Easy (300 points), Medium (400 points), and Hard (500 points). The harder you set the game, the harder the Gorgon becomes when fighting! To adjust the difficulty setting click on the +/- buttons within the window. You can adjust the difficulty during the game prior to winning.
        Description Style	There are two choices:  AD&D and Simple. The first follows standard rules of AD&D for those players already familiar with this genre. The alternate choice eliminates the terminology used in AD&D and is meant for players who are not familiar with dungeons and dragons games.
^F02 
^F02 
^#051     Battle Settings
        Adjust the Battle Difficulty by clicking on the +/- buttons within the window. 
     Battle Difficulty	Adjusting the Difficulty rating controls the tactics used by enemy units while attacking and moving onto the battlefield.
     Battle Speed	Adjusting the Speed makes your enemies decide their actions faster or slower, giving you more or less time to think and move your units. 
^F02 
^F02 
^#050     Adventure Settings
     Adjust adventure difficulty, combat mode, combat speed, and the default camera view by clicking on the +/- buttons in the window.
   Difficulty	Your opponents become tougher as you increase the difficulty. 
   Combat Mode	Real Time	In this mode, your and your opponent's attacks occur at the same time, and there is no pause in the battle. You had better act quickly or your enemies will take the advantage.
          Turn-based	This combat mode gives you time to deliberate and choose your next action. After everyone in your party has acted and your turn is over, then the enemy attacks. This is the true role playing game combat mode.
   Combat Speed	When in real-time combat mode, your opponents' damage speed increases or decreases when you adjust the combat speed. What that means is that more animations are played before actual damage is dealt.
   Default View	This option allows you to choose in which view you want to position the camera during adventures. It will follow the leader except during person combat. Only at that time will the camera automatically move to a position where the entire group is in the picture. It will remain in that position while the fight continues. When tabbing through the other characters in your party, the camera will adjust the view to make that character the center of the action. Remember that you can also use the F5 through the F9 keys to move the camera to the position you want.
^F02 
^F02 
^#052     Music and Sound
     Adjust the Sound, Music, and Sound Effects by clicking on the +/- button in the Options window.
          Sound Channels	The Sound Channels allow the user to select the MAXIMUM number of sounds (channels) that can be played simultaneously, i.e. eight channels equals eight sounds playing at the same time. There are two reasons to lower this number below eight. One is to make the sounds play more smoothly from slower CD-ROM drives. The other is that it might make the game run faster, especially on computers at or near the minimum requirements. However, if you set the number of channels at too low a number, you may lose voice cues giving critical information.
^F02 
     Before setting the channels below four, please consider these options in this order: 
          1.	If you selected the small installation, reinstall and select the medium installation. This moves most of the sound files onto the hard drive, cutting access time dramatically.
          2.	Turn off the Environmental Sounds. (Before you do this, read Environment Button information below.)
          3.	Turn off the Music by setting the volume to zero. It locks up one channel all by itself. 
          4.	Music Volume and Effects Volume	The Music Volume and Effects Volume choices raise or lower the volume for each specific audio feature with ten being the loudest.
^F02 
          Environment Button	The Environment button toggles on and off the ambient (existing on all sides) background sounds within adventures.There is an Environmental sound scene for every adventure based on its degree of evil. The only reason to turn the sounds off is that it might speed up exploring (not the fighting) in the adventures. It will have no effect at the map level or on the battleground.
^F02 
^F02 
^#053     Screen Size
          Screen Size	This is the default size of the adventure viewport. It is adjusted by clicking the +/- keys.
          Auto-Resolution	This is toggled on and off by clicking the +/- keys. Birthright adentures run fastest with a small screen and the Auto-Resolution set to On. The disadvantage is that the graphics are fuzzy.
          Direct Draw	This option is a Windows only feature. It allows the game to takeover the screen as if it were running in DOS. With Auto Resolution on, it may even be a tad faster.

^#026^F06Multiplayer Game Play
^F02 
   There are a few significant differences between a single player and a multiplayer game, but for the most part, they are identical. Except for the differences noted, refer to the single player rules to get the information you need about a section. 
^F02 
1.  In a multiplayer game, you can only move your troops on your turn of realm management.
^F02 
     2.	Multiplayer adventures have three significant differences from single-player adventures:
          a.	An adventure occurs only if the majority of the players want to use one of their three domain actions on an adventure. If the vote is tied, then the adventure does not begin.
          b. 	The object of the adventure is a race to be the first to find the relic. Each player controls and runs his own adventure. In other words, what one does has no effect on the other players.
          c. 	The player who initiated the adventure has complete control over it. This means the starting player chooses the adventure, and if that player decides to exit the adventure, then it is over for everyone.
^F02 
     3.	In multiplayer battles, differences include the following.
          a.	There is an additional feature:  the Chat Box. 
          b.	All battles involving the computer opponents are resolved with a die roll.
          c.	Players will have the option of commanding a battle only if it's a two-player game and the two players are battling each other. The battle will be conducted the same way as with a single player battle except that the opponent will be human. 
          d.	You cannot kill player regents in battle. They will escape to either a friendly territory or to their battle opponent's territory. However, if the player regent doesn't have any friendly territories and if his battle adversary has troops in all of the territories adjacent to the battle site, then the player regent will die.
^F02 
   When you want to play a multiplayer game, you must first choose how and where you wish to connect to play the game. See the Game Environment menu for instructions for playing a multiplayer game.

^#298Local Area Network / Modem Play
   Network play allows a group of players on a network to play the same game simultaneously and to challenge each other. Each player must use the same protocol. One person will serve as the host and start the game. The remaining players will then connect to that host through the network. When all are connected, the number of players having been input by the host, the game begins with a randomly selected assignment of regents to players.
^F02 
   There are several choices to step through prior to playing the game. These are detailed in the following:
      1.	Enter your name by typing it in, following the prompt at the top of the dialog box. 
      2.	Select your protocol (described later in this section).
      3.	Choose between joining a game or beginning a new game. 
^F02 
         New Game
         Only one player can begin a game and serve as its host. The host gives the game a name and types in how many players will be joining that game. The host then chooses the type of game from the next menu where he selects the Detail Level (Basic, Advanced, or Expert), the speed allowed for a turn, and the difficulty of the game (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
^F02 
         Join/Load Game
         If you are one of the players who will be joining a game, left-click on Load Game and the Done button. The program will then look for current games on the network and display a list of those games. Click on the one you wish to join. When all of the players have joined the game, it will begin with the random assignment of regent characters.

^F02 
^F02 
^#122^#130Taxation Overview
^F02 
   Regency, Domain Power, and Bloodline Strength are displayed in the top right corner.
   On the left side of the taxation screen the provinces you own are marked in red, orange, green, or blue, denoting their loyalty grade. Provinces which you do not own, but have holdings in are marked in gray. To the left of the province names is the shield of the Realm that owns each province. This shield can be used to identify Holdings or Assets on the Anuire Realm Map and to identify Realms when conducting most Domain Actions.
   There are two numbers separated by a slash to the right of the province list. The first number is the Province Level, and the second number is the Source Level Potential. Continuing across the page we find the tax levels column where you can set the tax level for the provinces you own. The loyalty change icon and number tell you how your tax levels and actions, such as the realm spell, Demagogue or Occupation, incur loyalty grade and revenue adjustments. The Law Claims column shows how all law holdings may attempt to claim money generated by province taxation or collection from a holding in the same province. Lastly, the tax column shows the average amount of revenue generated by each province and its Holdings.
^F02 
^#253Assets
   Anything a regent controls that is not a province or holding is known as an asset. The regent controls the expenditure of money, the building of castles, and the movements of armies. Ten types of assets exist:
   Regency Points	Bloodline Strength
   Ports	Armies
   Fortifications Castles	Ley Lines
   Lieutenants	Roads
   Trade Routes	Treasuries (Gold Bars)
^F02 
NOTE
Because of their central role in defining a realm, provinces and holdings are not considered to be simple assests.
^F02 
^#252Assets - Fortifications
   Fortifications (castles) make a province more difficult to attack. A castle protects an entire province.
   Fortifications are rated by level, just like provinces and holdings. A castle can be built up only to the maximum civilization level of the province in which it is built.
^F02 
^#256Assets - Lieutenants
   Lieutenants are loyal and competent followers who can help a regent address the numerous daily problems that arise. If a regent doesn't have time to ride over to the borderland and hunt bandits, he can appoint a lieutenant to settle the problem. Lieutenants aren't really assets in a physical sense, but they're as important as castles or armies.
^F02 
^#116^#250Assets - Trade Routes
   Trade routes generate income for a domain and are rated by level to reflect their importance. Two kinds of trade routes exist: routes between two provinces of different terrain types and routes within a single coastal province to represent sea trade. Note that all sea routes are in place when the game begins, and new sea routes cannot be created.
^F02 
^#251Assets - Armies
   Armies are the military forces at a character's disposal. Generally, a regent can raise an army, draft a levy, or create a militia as he sees fit, as long as he rules the province in which he does so. Regents who control only holdings cannot raise armies.
^F02 
^#257Assets - Ley Lines
   Ley lines are conduits created by wizards to carry magical power from one province to another. Realm spells require enormous amounts of magical power; a ley line allows a wizard to carry magical energy from a strong magical area to a weak one in order to cast a realm spell.
^F02 
^#254^#255Assets - Roads
   Roads, not surprisingly, allow easy movement between provinces for armies (and adventurers, too). They're particularly important in regions of rough terrain, such as heavy forests, mountains, and swamps. Roads are also necessary to support overland trade routes.
^F02 
^#118Shield
   The name of your realm and ruling regent are shown in the top left of the screen. 
^F02 
^#124Domain Power
   Every domain turn, a regent increases his Regency Point score by a number equal to his bloodline strength score or the sum of his domain power, whichever is smaller. A character's domain power is the amount of regency all of his Province Levels and Holdings generate; it is the sum of all the levels of holdings and provinces applicable to the regent.
^F02 
   Character classes can only collect regency from certain holdings. This may affect which realm you choose to rule and what kind of game emphasis you want.
^F02 
Holding/Asset 	Classes that Collect Regency
   Guild	Thief, Ranger, 
   Law	Warrior, Priest*, Thief*
   Source	Wizard
   Temple	Priest, Paladin
   Province	All
   Trade Route	Thief (one RP per GB produced)
* Characters of this class collect regency equal to half the holding's level, rounded up.
^F02 
^#125Bloodline Strength
   The range of a character's bloodline strength depends on his/her bloodline level. The closer the bloodline strength number is to the highest number in the range, the better.
Bloodline Level	Range
   Tainted	4 - 16
   Minor		5 - 30
   Major 		8 - 48
   Great		8 - 64
   Imagine that you have two characters with a bloodline level of major which has a range of bloodline strength from 8 - 48. If one character has a bloodline strength of 25, that strength is less than 50% of his potential. If another character has a strength of 46, he is very near the maximum possible.
^F02 
   Background concerning bloodline strength and ancestral derivation is detailed more thoroughly in the History and Atlas sections contained in Birthrt.hlp and accessed by clicking on the History and Atlas button on the game's Help screen. Bloodline affects realm play as your Regency point score each turn is generated by either your Bloodline Strength or your Domain Power, whichever is smaller. By spending Regency points equal to your bloodline strength plus one additional point, you can buy one point of bloodline strength. This may appear to be a high cost for one added regency point per turn, but as you play the game, your domain power quickly grows greater than your bloodline. In a longer game, buying a bloodline point, and thus another regency point per turn, can be a smart, strategic investment.
^F02 
^F02 
Province Taxation
   On the left side of the taxation screen the provinces you own are marked in red, orange, green, or blue, denoting their loyalty grade. Provinces which you do not own, but in which you have holdings are marked in gray. To the left of the province names is the shield of the realm that owns each province. This shield can be used to identify Holdings or Assets on the Anuire Realm Map and identify realms when conducting most Domain Actions.
^F02 
^#131Treasury
   The treasury total above the Tax column shows the amount of Gold Bars remaining from the previous domain turn. 
^F02 
   The treasury of a domain is critical to a regent's success, since castles and armies cost money. Although most regents have extensive lands and properties under their control, a treasury consists of only coinage and other hard assets. A wise regent keeps a close eye on the state of his treasury -- it's embarrassing to start a war and then run out of money to pay the troops.
^F02 
^#102Source Holdings
   Sources represent the magic power of a province. Unlike other holdings, a source's level is much lower in highly-developed areas, since the clearing and settling of the land weakens natural magical forces. Untouched lands hold the most magical power; thus, the potential of a source varies inversely with the level of the province in which it lies. A province(8) may be able to support no more than a source(1) or (2).
^F02 
   Sources may be controlled by characters other than wizards, but only wizards reap the benefits of controlling a source. Wizards who control a source may cast realm spells.
^F02 
   The level of the source holding should not be confused with the Source Level Potential. The source level potential is the number on the right of the slash next to the province level. The maximum source holding level depends on the terrain of the province, which determines its highest possible level. Other holdings' maximum levels are determined and limited by the province level. Wizard regents collect one regency point for each level of each source holding they own.
^F02 
   Source holdings can be created by the use of Create Holding and their level improved by the Rule domain actions. Higher level source holdings can be linked to lower level sources with the Forge Ley Line domain action to cast Wizard Realm Spells that could not be cast from the lower level source holding alone.
^F02 
^F02 
Tax Levels
   To set the tax level for each province you own, click in the box to place a checkmark for the taxation level of that province. You can Pillage a province either before or after you have clicked the Collect Taxes button. Pillaging before taxes drops the province level by one and lowers the amount of taxes you may receive.
^F02 
   Light, Moderate, and Severe taxes affect the Province Loyalty and generate more or less gold in revenue for that province. Each level of taxation also alters the Loyalty Change icon and modifier. The table below illustrates how many gold bars are generated each Domain Turn, depending on the province level and the tax level. The actual number in the range of gold bars is calculated by the computer and added to your treasury after you click the Collect Taxes button.
^F02 
^#126Province Taxation
Province	Light	Moderate	Severe
Rating	Taxes	Taxes		Taxes
0	-	-		0-1
1	0-1	0-2		1-3
2	0-2	1-3		1-4
3	1-3	1-4		2-5
4	1-4	2-5		2-7
5	2-5	2-7		2-9
6	2-7	2-9		2-11
7	2-9	2-11		2-13
8	2-11	2-13		2-16
9	2-13	2-16		4-18
10	2-16	4-18		4-22
^F02 
^#128Loyalty Change/Law Icon
   This column shows the Law Icon and the current loyalty change modifier adjusted by the Tax Level in that province. The Law icon shows how the level of the Law Holding in that province is affecting loyalty. It is represented by a small turret graphic that is changed according to the level of the law holding as follows:
	If the law holding level is less than half of the province level, then there is an X through the turret. The province cannot ignore loyalty grade penalties.
	If the law holding level is greater than 1/2 the province level, but less than equal, there is a 1/2 fraction next to the icon. The province can ignore one loyalty grade change.
	If the law holding level is equal to the province level, the turret icon remains unchanged. The province can ignore two loyalty grade changes. 
Any penalties or bonuses to loyalty grade are applied at the end of the following Domain Turn.
^F02 
^#129Law Claims
   All law holdings may attempt to claim money generated by province taxation or collection from a holding in the same province. A regent can attempt to claim money earned by taxing his own provinces, but he'll only break even. Be careful, as law claims made in your allies' provinces may break or jeopardize your alliance. You can receive between 0-3 Gold Bars through Law Claims depending on the level of your law holding and the level of the holding you are claiming from.
^F02 
^#104Tax Column
   When the tax column is grayed out, it shows the potential average of gold bars generated by the province by its guild and temple holdings before you Collect Taxes. After your tax roll, this column shows in black the actual amount of gold bars generated.
^F02 
^#105Tax Collected
   This shows the actual amount that was raised by collecting taxes. 
^F02 
^#115Pillage
   Pillaging a province allows the occupying commander to perform the equivalent of Severe Taxation on the province. He can pillage one level for each unit present, up to the level of the province. In other words, an army of three units in a province of level three or better can tax as if the province were level three. Pillaging reduces the province by one level. If the province level drops below the levels of the holdings in the pillaged province, the holding levels also decrease to match the new province level. It's possible to pillage your own provinces also.
^F02 
^#132New Treasury
   The New Treasury displays the treasury. After taxes are collected, the number can still be changed by altering maintenance and troop payments, but tax levels cannot change.
^F02 
^F02 
^#113^#170Occupation	Overview
^F02 
   On the left side of the taxation screen, the provinces you own are marked in red, orange, green, or blue, denoting their loyalty grade. Provinces which you do not own but have holdings in, are marked in gray. To the left of the province names is the shield of the realm that owns each province. This shield can be used to identify Holdings or Assets on the Anuire Realm Map and identify realms when conducting most Domain Actions.
^F02 
   To the right of the province list are two numbers separated by a slash. The first number is the Province Level, and the second is the Source Level. Farther right is the Occupy Own column which, when checked, makes the Reduce Foreign Holdings and Pillage province columns active and accessible. Reducing foreign holdings and pillaging for extra gold bars are the two reasons you may choose to occupy your own province with troops. The Loot column shows the amount of Gold Bars pillaged. This amount is the equivalent to severe taxation on the province. In the top right corner there is information concerning Regency, Domain Power, Bloodline Strength, Treasury, and Tax Collected.
^F02 
   When no defending forces are left in a province or the only defender is a castle, the attacker gains control of the province. He receives the option of occupying or pillaging the province. Each unit occupying a province counts as one law holding for purposes of loyalty and taxation. Thus, occupying a province(4) with four units of troops allows a regent to perform severe taxation without pushing the people into rebellion. A province under enemy occupation generates no regency or taxes in gold for the province ruler until it is held once again by the ruler's units at the end of a Domain Turn. As long as the conquering regents' units occupy the province with at least one unit, he can perform taxation and replace the ruler in all respects, but he cannot collect regency until he invests the province using the domain action: Investiture. To invest, you must occupy the province from the third domain action of the last turn to the first domain action of the next domain turn without being attacked by enemy units. Note that each province under occupation adds one gold bar to the occupier's domain maintenance costs. Pillaging reduces the civilization level by one.
^F02 
^#117Occupy Own
   Check boxes in this column activate the Reduce Foreign Holdings and Pillage Boxes. You may choose to occupy your own province to reduce foreign holdings or to generate extra revenue by pillaging and looting the province. Each unit that occupies a province, up to the province level, may perform the equivalent of severe taxation by pillaging. Doing so incurs a -1 loyalty grade change. Each unit occupying a province counts as one law holding for purposes of loyalty and taxation. Thus, occupying a province(4) with four units of troops allows a regent to perform severe taxation without pushing the people into rebellion.
^F02 
^#114Reduce Foreign Holdings
   You may check boxes in this column after you have selected to occupy one of your own provinces. Doing so reduces all foreign Law, Temple, and Guild Holdings to 0 and lowers all foreign Source Holdings by one level. This can affect Diplomacy, and the status of your alliances with realms with holdings in your provinces may deteriorate.
^F02 
^F02 
^#107Payroll
   This screen details the number and type of units you have and how much you pay them in Gold Bars or Regency. 
^F02 
^#164Gold
   As you adventure, pick up gold and other treasures. When you exit an adventure, this gold is turned into the gold bars used in realm play. You receive one experience point for each gold piece you picked up. Thieves receive two experience points for each gold piece.
^F02 
^#119Units and Provinces
   The Unit and Province columns list the types of units you have in each province. The units column shows regular units, your lieutenants and your regent. For more information on units, see Troop Icon Descriptions and Unit Types and Strengths. The small "L-shaped" superscript shows that these units are Joined Units88. The province column shows the Province Loyalty and relates where the troops in the units column are located on the Anuire Realm Map. See Stacked Units.
^F02 
^#120Pay Gold and Pay Regency
   The check boxes in the Pay Gold and Pay Regency columns let you decide how to pay your troops. When the game begins, the default is set to pay your units with gold. However, you may want to pay your troops with regency if you are low on gold. You may choose to pay some with gold and some with regency. The computer automatically adjusts your treasury and regency totals for you. If you do not pay your units at all, with either gold or regency, those units unchecked and unpaid disband and disappear from the realm map. This option can be used if you have finished fighting a war and do not need as many units or if the payroll costs are too high for your treasury. Mercenaries that go unpaid do not disband. Instead they roam the realms as random monsters.
^F02 
^#121Payroll Maintenance Cost
   The Maintenance Cost column tallies the cost of each unit in gold bars. No number appears if you pay that unit with regency. Above and below this column, find the information on Regency, Domain Power, Bloodline Strength, Treasury, Tax Collected, Pillage, Trade Routes, Payroll totals, and Maintenance.
^F02 
^F02 
^#006Maintenance	Overview
^F02 
^#098Castles
^F02 
   Each castle requires one gold bar per domain turn to maintain. The castle's level decreases by one for each turn that this box is not checked to pay for its maintenance. The total costs for all the castles you own are found at the bottom right of the Maintenance screen.
^F02 
   Castles are represented by a series of icons dependent on the castle's level. Wizard towers can be created only by the realm spell, Stronghold, and are in all other respects treated the same as castles. Both castles and wizard towers help defend a province from army units, occupation, and investiture. 
^F02 
   Castles are created by two means:  the Wizard Realm Spell, Stronghold, or the domain action, Fortify. Castles prevent your provinces from being invested and conquered. In order to conquer and invest a province with a castle, an army with at least as many units as the castle level must occupy the province. If a province is invested using the domain action, Investiture, the castle remains as one of the enemy's holdings until it is destroyed by siege or spell. If the last province in the enemy's realm is invested, the castle becomes your holding at its current level. Only the Wizard Realm Spell, Raze, or a siege can neutralize a castle. The Raze spell can drop a castle's level or destroy it outright, depending on the Regency spent on the spell. As long as there are a number of units in the province equal to the castle's current level, a siege by army units lowers the castle's level by one level each Domain Turn until it is destroyed. If the number of units drops below the current level of the castle, the siege is broken. The siege can be broken any time prior to the castle being destroyed by the castle being reduced to level 0. The same is true for wizard towers.
^F02 
   A castle forces any hostile army that enters its province to stop immediately. Enemy units cannot pass through the province; they must stop or return to the province from which they came. 
^F02 
^#097Holdings
^F02 
   Holdings represent a regent's interests in a province and the level of that interest. Holding can be guilds, law, temples, and sources. The type of holding determines what type of interest the regent has. 
^F02 
	Guild holdings control trade and business. They generate revenue by controlling the distribution of goods in a province and through trade routes.
	Law holdings represent the control of 
	a.	law and order if the province is the regent's.
	b.	banditry and lawlessness if the province is ruled by someone else. Regents don't look kindly on other regents who support banditry in the realm, but the holding regent skims revenue from the province with his bandits.
	Temple holdings generate revenue through tithes. If the regent is a priest or has a priest in his party, temples are the source of spells.
	Source holdings generate no revenue but are the source of magic for wizards.
Each holding is shown on the map by its own icon. Each icon has a small shield with the colors of the realm that owns it. This shield has two crossed swords through it if the holding has been contested. See the domain action Contest. 
^F02 
   Holdings are created using the domain action, Create Holding. They can be improved primarily by the domain action, Rule, and reduced by the domain action, Contest. A province is limited in the number of holdings it can support. Each province is considered to have a number of slots equal to its level available for each type of holding. Thus, a province(4) can accommodate up to four levels of law holdings, four levels of temple holdings, and four levels of guild holdings. The number and level of source holdings decrease as the province level increases and are dependent on the Source Level Potential. The sum of the levels of source holdings cannot exceed the source level potential (the number on the right of the slash mark). The level of any holding cannot exceed the level of the province, with the exception of source holdings. As the province level and thus the relative development and population of the province increase, the natural magical source potential goes down. This may affect which realm you choose to play. A strong trade realm usually has low magical sources which necessitates Ley Lines to outside provinces in order to become a strong magical power. 
^F02 
   Normally, the ruler of a province controls some of the holdings in his province. Other regents and non-player characters may also claim guilds, temples, law, or sources in the domain. This means that several characters may have influence in the same province, even though only one regent rules it. In fact, more than one character may control a single type of holding (i.e., in a province(4), two different regents might each control two levels of temple holdings). 
^F02 
   You can get other information on holdings in the Holdings descriptions sections on the Anuire Realm Map. Regents collect gold from their holdings. However, you may only collect gold from guilds and temples. Sources never generate gold, and law holdings can only generate gold bars through the use of Law Claims. The table in Guild and Temple Collection shows the variable income of gold bars which is dependent on both the province and the holding level. The actual Gold Bars that can be collected each Domain Turn is shown in the Holdings Taxation Table.
^F02

^F02 
^F02 
^#099Law Holdings
^F02 
   Law Holdings control the Province Loyalty. As the law level is raised closer to the province level, the loyalty of that province becomes more stable. Warriors receive one Regency point for each level of each law holding they own. Priests and thieves collect regency equal to one half of each holding's level. Law holdings may claim revenue in gold from other holdings within the same province in the form of Law Claims. Law holdings can be created by the domain action, Create Holding, and their levels raised with the domain action, Rule.
^F02 
   Law holdings are any entities, ranging from marauding vigilantes to the king's royal guard, that affect a ruler's ability to control a province and the loyalty of his government's servants, including bureaucrats and constables. When a law holding belongs to a regent who is hostile to the province's ruler, it represents banditry and lawlessness. Wise rulers try to control at least some law holdings in provinces they rule, since this improves their ability to control rebellious areas.
^F02 
^#101Guild Holdings
^F02 
   Guilds tend to be the building blocks of thief domains, although any class of regent may control guild holdings. In Cerilia, hundreds of artisan guilds and merchant companies control trade. A regent who controls mostly guilds is likely to be a merchant prince, an investor, or an underworld figure, although a guild is almost always a legitimate business.
^F02 
   Each level of guild holding represents control of a similar amount of the province's wealth; a guild(2) in a province(4) is thus responsible for about 50% of the economy of the province.
Thieves and rangers collect one regency point for each level of each guild holding that they own. Bards collect regency equal to one half the holdings level, rounded up. Guild holdings can be created with the domain action Create Holding and their level raised by the domain action: Rule. 
^F02 
   A regent must control guild holdings in order to create trade routes.
^F02 
^#103Regency Column
   The total sum of each province's regency, including the province level and the holdings that are eligible for collection (determined by the regent's class), is shown in this column. The total regency of all provinces owned by the realm constitutes the regent's Domain Power.

^#167Maintenance Overview
   The names of your realm and regent, as well as your realm's shield are located in the top left, as they are on all the Realm Management screens. On the left is information concerning your Province Loyalty, Province Level, and Source Level Potential. You must pay one gold bar every Domain Turn for each province under the Occupation of your units. The total cost to maintain your army in occupied provinces is listed on the bottom right side of the screen.
^F02 
   Some of your Assets are castles, which can protect your province from being conquered by invading armies. One gold bar per castle per Domain Turn is required for maintenance.
The next four columns list your Law, Temple, Guild, and Source Holdings in each province. These holdings generate gold and regency, keep up the loyalty of your provinces, and create magical power for your Realm Spells. The Regency column totals the regency generated by your holdings. Only specific holdings generate regency and gold for each character class. The Tax Column and Tax Collected columns display and total the gold bars generated by your holdings. 
^F02 
   If your maintenance costs exceed your revenue in gold bars, you'll need to do one or more of the following to generate more gold:  raise taxes, disband units by not paying them on the Payroll screen, occupy and pillage your own provinces, lower your Court, or do not maintain either foreign provinces under Occupation or any castles you own. If you try all of the above and still have a negative treasury, your current game is over.
^F02 
^F02 
^#013Reports
   At the start of each domain turn you are shown a screen displaying your four advisors. These are your chamberlain, your general, your mage, and your spymaster. On the first domain turn these advisors give you a summery of the status of your realm to date. On subsequent turns these advisors give you reports as shown under their titles.
^F02 
      Your chamberlain informs you of:
	a.	The strength of your realm and the top ten realms. See Realm Strength.
	b.	The loyalty levels of the realms in Anuire. See Loyalty Report.
      Your general tells you:
	a.	Who has been at war with each other. See War Report.
	b.	The size of your army and the ten largest armies in Anuire. See Troop Report.
      Your mage tells you:
	a.	What adventures have become available. See Adventure News Report.
	b.	What provinces have been invested recently. See Investitures Report.
      Your spy tells you with whom you are allied and the level of that alliance.

^#304Realm Strength Report
   Starting on domain turn two, your chamberlain presents you with the Realm Strength report. This report shows your progress to the Iron Throne, as well as the progress of the ten leading contenders. The report is broken down as follows. On the left-hand side of the report is displayed the names of the ten leading realms, above these your realm is displayed. To the right of the realm names is shown the realm's current points score; this helps show how close you are to winning the game. To the right of the realm's score are two bar graphs, the upper graph shows how your score relates to your diplomacy, the bottom graph shows the difference between each realm's number of holdings. The bottom of the report displays the key, or legend, for reading the score and graphs. In the upper right corner of the report displays the turn number.
^F02 
^F02 
^#058Loyalty Report
   Starting on Domain Turn two, your Chamberlain presents you with the Loyalty Report. The report displays each realm's relationship, diplomacy and war standing. A legend defining the relationship between realms is displayed on the bottom of the report. The chart shows how the realms in the horizontal rows view the realms in the vertical columns. Note that the opposite is not necessarily true. If one realm views the other as having a permissive alliance, switching the realms' places on the rows and columns shows a permissive alliance as well. However, if one realm views the other as vassals, the other realm views their liege lord as a full alliance. Similarly, if one realm has declared war, it will not necessarily be mutual.

   Zoom in on the map for more detail by left-clicking the mouse on a location. The map then moves into that spot with the point where you clicked in the center of the screen. Left-clicking on another location in this close-up view scrolls the map automatically so that the new spot is again in the center of the screen.
To zoom out to the full map display, right-click on the Zoom button in the lower right corner of the game screen. At any time the plus (zoom-in) and minus (zoom-out) keys on the numeric keypad can be used to control this function. Province names and levels are displayed on the map after you zoom in; zooming out causes them to vanish.
^F02 
   To scroll around the map, use the arrow keys in the following way:
	up:	scrolls the map north
	down:	scrolls south
	left:	scrolls west
	right:	scrolls east
^F02 
^#210Realm Descriptions
   A realm is a region containing one or more provinces. The realm you have selected to begin building your kingdom is bound by heavy red lines, while all other realm boundaries are outlined by heavy black lines. As a realm grows or weakens in power, the number of provinces they control changes. The changes are always shown on the map as soon as they occur. When war is declared, a set of red crossed swords appears next to the hostile border between the realms. 
^F02 
^#211Province Descriptions
   A province is a division within a realm. Provinces are outlined with dashed black lines. Inside each province, its name is printed next to two numbers separated by a slash. The first number is the Province Level, and the second is its Source Level Potential. These numbers range from zero to ten. The province level is an indication of how settled and developed the province is, a low number represents a region of sparse habitation with few settlements or industry. Source level indicates how much magical energy flows through the province. Since human development reduces the flow of magical energies, the higher the province level, the lower the potential source level.
^F02 
   The vital characteristic of a province is its level; this is an overall measure of its prosperity and importance. Province levels are abbreviated for game play by placing the level number in parentheses behind the holding. For example, "Prince Wilhelm rules a province (2)." means "Prince Wilhelm rules a level 2 province."
^F02 
^#212Troop Icon Descriptions
   There are different icons for each type of unit. You can right-click on any unit on the map to get a description of the unit's six attributes. See Unit Types and Strengths. Left-clicking on one of your own units shows the name of the unit type or the name of all the units in a stack. See Stacked Units. By clicking on the arrow next to a unit within the stack, you can move it to the top where right-clicking for the unit description is possible. If the unit is your regent or a lieutenant you can right-click to bring up their Character Status screen. Other pop-up dialog boxes appear when you have Joined Units. 
^F02 
^#213Character Inventory
   You can right-click on any regent's or lieutenant's icon on the realm map to bring up their Status Screen. However, only your own regent's or lieutenant's Inventory Screen is accessible. Foreign regent's and Lieutenant's screens are not available.
^F02 
^#206Realm Spells
   Realm spells can never be used in adventures, only in realm play. They cannot be used or equipped from the inventory screen. Highlighting the spell name to get a description of its effects is the only reason to view realm spells in the inventory screen.
^F02 
   Both you and other realms can cast realm spells during the Domain Turn. A graphic symbol of the realm spell is placed within the borders of the province it is affecting. These spells can last one or more domain turns. The spells are listed below. See also Wizard Realm Spells and Priest Realm Spells

^F02 
^F02 
Terrain Descriptions
   Realms contain many types of terrain. Each terrain type affects troop movement and movement costs. Terrain also gives certain advantages and disadvantages to each type of unit in army battle.
See	Choosing Terrain and Troop Movement Costs.
^F02 
^#199Seaports
   Seaports are shown on the realm map by either a lighthouse-and-pier icon or a village-and-ship icon. Seaports have trade routes with far-off lands and generate considerable revenue for their owners. Right-click on one of them for further information.
^F02 
   All ports generate gold bars equal to half of the province level in which they are located. This revenue is added to the totals on the realm management screens under Other Income.
^F02 
^F02 
^#220Anuire Map Buttons
   There are six buttons in the lower right-hand corner of the map display. These turn on and off some of the informational icons displayed on the map. These icons indicate military Units and Provinces and the ^F02 
^F02 
   Holdings controlled by the regents of the game realms. These buttons have the following effects:
	Select Domains Button		Display Temple Holdings Button
	Display Law Holdings Button	Display Source Holdings Button
	Display Guild Holdings Button	Zoom In/Out Button
^F02 
^#219Select Domains Button
   This button opens the left edge of the screen and displays a list of all the realms and the major independent power blocks that exist in Anuire. The list to the left shows the landed realms that control provinces; the list on the right displays the independent domains that control no territory, such as major churches, trading guilds, and powerful wizards. These independent domains control Holdings, but do not have armies. 
^F02 
   Your realm and your full allies are printed in blue, green for permissive alliances, yellow for antagonistic realms, and your enemies are in red. Realms that have placed themselves in Vassalage to you are printed in purple.
^F02 
   Next to each name are two check boxes. The first is for military units; the second is for holdings. The military box toggles on and off the display of each realm's military units. The holdings box likewise controls the display of icons indicating which holdings each realm controls. By turning these icons on or off, it is possible to better monitor the activities of specific realms.
^F02 
   At the bottom of both lists is a set of master check boxes for each column. These are used to add or remove checkmarks from the entire column.
^F02 
   Click the Domains button to close the Units and Holdings list on the left.
^F02 
   Spotting Units:  Unlike guild halls and temples, military units are quite mobile, and can easily hide from a realm's spies. Because of this, many units are hidden from view until they are spotted by the domain action, Espionage or the Relic Of Power, Danica's Crystal Ball of Scrying. However, once units are discovered they are tracked and marked on the map.
^F02 
^#258Vassalage
   Domains need not be ruled absolutely. A weak regent often will pledge loyalty and support to a stronger regent in exchange for peace. This arrangement is known as vassalage.
^F02 
   By taking the oaths of vassalage, a weaker regent agrees to donate some of his Regency Points to the stronger regent. The stronger regent receives more power, and the weaker one preserves his domain and his life.
^F02 
^#218Law Holdings Button
   This button displays the Law Holdings of the realms that have a checkmark on the Select Domains screen.
^F02 
^#217Guild Holdings Button
   This button displays the realms' Guild Holdings when checked on the Select Domains screen.
^F02 
^#216Temple Holdings Button
   This button displays the Temple Holdings of the realms that have a checkmark on the Select Domains screen.
^F02 
^#215Source Holdings Button
   This button displays the Source holdings of the realms that have a checkmark on the Select Domains screen.
^F02 
^#209Zoom Button
   Left-clicking this button zooms the map out to its highest magnification. See Navigating the Map.
^F02 
^#004Domain Actions
   Clicking the Domain Action button after Rolling for Taxes brings up the domain action screen to the left of the Anuire Realm Map. At the top of the screen you'll find your regent's name and his/her current amount of Regency and Gold Bars in the Treasury.
^F02 
   Just under the treasury you are prompted to select your first, second, or third action. The level of game play that you selected when you chose Begin New Game (Basic, Advanced, or Expert) determines how many of the 18 domain action buttons you'll see on your screen. Regardless, you must choose three actions to complete your Domain Turn. If you see a domain action that is grayed-out with a red bar through it, it cannot be used at this time. For instance, you cannot Declare War after the second domain action of a turn, and that button is grayed-out during the third domain action.
^F02 
   Certain actions do not require the one month that most others take. These are called Free Actions, because they do not count towards the three needed to complete your domain turn.
^F02

^#177Experience Points for Domain Actions
   Successfully completed domain actions also give regents realm experience points towards increasing their Level as they do in Adventures. These experience points awarded are dependent on the regent's Class and are listed in the table below. Also see Experience.
^F02 
   For the purpose of this table, Bards are considered Thieves, Paladins as fighters, and Rangers as fighters.

^F02 
^F02 
^#040Free Actions
   Free actions do not count towards the three Domain Actions necessary to complete a Domain Turn. They are assumed to be enacted by your Lieutenants or a quick decree from the regent. Free actions include Muster, Build Road, and Troop Movement. These three actions may be done as many times per domain turn as the regent desires, providing there is enough gold and regency. Regents who are priests get to do one Agitate each domain turn as a free action, and thief regents get to do Espionage once per domain turn as a free action. Lieutenant Action is a free action, but can only be done once per domain turn.
^F02 
^F02 
^#225Troop Movement
   To move your units, simply left-click on an icon until you find the unit or stack of units you wish to move. This brings up a small pop-up window highlighting the type of unit or Stacked Units. Once the unit or Joined Units you wish to move is highlighted, click in an adjacent province in a spot where there are no other icons over the terrain.
^F02 
   The troops move automatically within your own realm but require the regent to Declare War before moving into foreign territory. If you try to move into a foreign province without declaring war an audio cue states, "Not permitted." There are two exceptions to this: You may move freely into provinces invested by random monsters and also into provinces owned by your allies and vassals. If you attempt to move into extremely rough terrain that only certain races of troops may enter, an audio cue states, "Impassable."
^F02 
   Troop movement is considered a free action although it does not have a button on the Domain Actions screen. Troops can move as often as the regent desires, providing there is enough gold to pay for the movement. Troops that are engaged with enemy troops cannot move until battle has concluded and the enemy units have fled or have been destroyed. If this is the case, an audio cue states, "Troops are engaged." 
^F02 
^F02 
^#226Troop Movement Cost
   Normally, it costs troop units one-tenth of a gold bar, per unit, per province, to move. This is modified by the type of terrain the unit or units are passing through. The table below shows the cost in tenths of gold bars for one unit to move one province through each type of terrain.
   Terrain		Cost 
   Forest			2/10 (1/10 for elves)
   Hills			2/10 (1/10 for dwarves)
   Mountains		4/10 (1/10 for dwarves)
   Mountain Range	Impassable
   Plains/Steppe/Farmland	1/10
   River			4/10
   Road			None
   Swamp/Marsh		3/10
^F02 
^F02 
^#224Stacked Units
   Joined Units are also called stacked units. Two or more joined units are called a stack. You can break a stack into smaller stacks or individual units by left-clicking on the units' icon. This highlights the stack and shows you all the units attached or joined under the top one. Now left-click anywhere in the stack. The unit you clicked on and all the units under it have split and are the only ones highlighted.
^F02 
To move a unit up through the ranks, click on the arrow buttons to the right of the unit name.
^F02 
   You may choose to do this for a variety of reasons: to create two smaller forces that can move into two provinces; to leave units behind to Occupy a province; to leave units behind to cut off a possible escape route for an enemy regent after a battle; or to bring a regent or lieutenant to the top of the troop stack so you can access their Status and Inventory Screen. If you left-click on the split stack of units, it becomes unhighlighted and is rejoined with its original stack. 
^F02 
^F02 
^#222Joined Units
   Units do not always move by themselves. Up to 15 units can move or do battle together. To move or battle together you must have your units joined. Anytime you move your units into another province where you also have units, a pop-up dialog box appears and asks, "Shall unit 'A' join unit 'B'?" You may choose yes, if you want to move or do battle with both those units at the same time, or no, if you want to leave a unit behind while the other moves to another province or goes into battle. If you choose no and you have another unjoined unit in the same province, you are asked, "Shall unit(s) 'A' join unit(s) 'C'?" This is repeated until you have either joined units or have been asked to join units with all separated troops within the province. Multiple units may join with multiple units, but the total number may never exceed 15. Any number of units that are joined are also called Stacked Units.
^F02 
^F02 
^#143Adventure Button
   You may choose to go adventuring for several reasons:  to take a break from Realm play, to quest for a Relic of Power, or to gain Experience Points and make your Regent or Lieutenants improve their Level and power. You may take up to four characters with you on an adventure, and your regent need not go. Instead, you may send lieutenants if you wish by using the Lieutenant Action button. 
^F02 
^F02 
^#042Lieutenants
   These are your trusted and faithful comrades who travel with you on adventures and battles. They can also act in your stead via the domain action Lieutenant Action (one free turn per domain turn).
^F02 
^#041Select and Equip Characters/Party
   Check the box next to the character's name to add him/her to your party. To equip each character, left-click on the name to bring up the Character Inventory Screen. (The screen will come up automatically for spell casters.) You may want to take a look at the Combat & Spell Use section of Adventures to gain an understanding of what spells and items you may need to equip. These screens contain instructions for you to equip your characters with the items and spells they need to successfully complete the adventure.
^F02 
^F02 
^#228^#229Cancel and Go on Adventure Buttons
   The Cancel button returns you to the Domain Action screen, while the Go on Adventure button takes you to the adventure site. Canceling does not cost you a domain action.
^F02 
^F02 
^#198^#205Memorizing Spells
   Spells can only be memorized in the Adventure Equipment Screen prior to starting the adventure. The scroll icon next to each spell has been replaced by +/- (Plus and Minus) buttons and next to each spell is a letter and number indicating the type of spell, (W)izard or (P)riest and its level (between one and nine for wizards and one and seven for priests). If no spell is highlighted, the lower information window displays the number of spells of each level currently available for memorization. For example, if you see, "Wizard spells left: 2/0/1", this indicates you have two first level, no second level spells, and one third level spell that are available for you to memorize. The Use114, Drop115, and Give116 buttons are replaced by Cast, Forget, and Memorize respectively within the adventure equipment screen.
^F02 
   To memorize or forget spells for the priest or wizard, click on the +/- buttons next to each spell or click on the spell name. Then, select either the Memorize or Forget button. You may memorize more than one of each spell as long as the lower information window shows that you have spells of that level available. Note that you may equip spells in the hot boxes only after you have actually entered the adventure. 
^F02 
   Remember that after entering the adventure, you are no longer able to memorize spells! The large information window now shows a scroll icon next to each spell. Clicking on these scrolls puts the appropriate spell into one of the hot boxes. It is advisable to do this immediately after the adventure has loaded, before you have an encounter with a hostile creature. Highlighting the text name provides a description of the spell and its effects. The Cast button can be used to cast from the inventory screen or you may use the hot boxes. See Adventure Quick Keys.

^#227Select Adventure Site
   This screen shows you a list of the available adventures. Click on an adventure name to choose your adventure. Then, check and prepare the party members you wish to take. Finally, click the Go on Adventure button.
^F02 
   If you complete an adventure, kill the primary adversary, and retrieve the quest object or Relics of Power, that adventure is removed from the list on any future adventuring expeditions. 
^F02 
^F02 
^#230^F06A^F02dventure Description Window
   The adventure description relates background information as well as hints concerning the major adversaries you will encounter and the object of your quest. When you have finished reading the introduction, click the "Go on Adventure" button to begin. Travel to the quest location happens automatically, and you do not pay any gold or regency costs to embark upon the quest. Even if the quest site is in a rival's territory, the party is considered to be skillful enough to avoid any encounters on the way to the adventure. After the quest is concluded, successful or not, all surviving characters return to the domain level where all damage is healed. All mundane objects like gold cups, keys, and weapons are sold off, and the money is placed into the regent's treasury. Magical objects including any unused potions remain in the appropriate inventory for later use.
^F02 
^F02 
^#144Agitate Button
   Agitate is used to raise or lower Province Loyalty. Any province you have a Holding in can be affected by an agitate action. This includes provinces you do not control. In the case of such provinces, you are affecting their loyalty to the controlling regent, not yourself. Thus, this action is very useful for undermining a rival's control over his realm.
^F02 
   When the agitate action is selected, a window opens over the map, listing all the provinces you have holdings in. These names are printed in the appropriate colors for their loyalty rating: red - rebellion, yellow - poor, green - average, blue - high. Should the number of provinces exceed the room allowed, a Next Page button is displayed at the bottom of the list.
^F02 
   Next to the provinces' names are six columns. The first lists their current loyalty rating. The next two columns are composed of two buttons, a Raise and Lower button. Click on which direction you want the province's loyalty to move. Loyalty can be raised or lowered by only one level. Thus, it may take two domain actions to raise a province from poor loyalty rating to a rating of high. You can try to change the loyalty of any number of the provinces listed in the agitate window; you are not limited to trying to modify just one province. You may be limited, however, by the current amount of gold bars and regency you have.
^F02 
   The fourth column is the chance of success for that one particular attempt to change the loyalty rating. All success chances are computed and paid for separately. 
^F02 
   The last two columns list the amount of gold and regency you are willing to spend to Modify Success for each province. Clicking on the Plus button raises the amount, clicking on the Minus button reduces it. At the bottom of the window, a running count is kept of how much you're spending. If at any time you try to spend more gold or regency then you have, the game announces "not enough gold" or "not enough regency".
^F02 
Click on the Roll button to resolve the attempts. Immediately after declaring the roll attempt, any regents who have holdings in the provinces you are trying to affect get a chance to spend their own gold or regency to counter your actions. If they do, you are informed of this, the success numbers are changed to reflect their expenditures, and you get a chance to counter their attempts by spending more gold or regency. This cycle continues until they are unwilling to spend any more. At that point all attempts at loyalty modification are resolved, and the results announced and marked. After all attempts are resolved and the results announced, click on the Done button to return to the main domain turn menu. At any time the Cancel button may be clicked to abort this action; if so, no gold or regency is spent.
^F02 
^#146Build Road Button
   Roads have two effects on the game: Troop Movement between two provinces linked by a road does not require the expenditure of gold, and roads are necessary when establishing Trade Routes.
^F02 
After selecting the Build Road action, a window appears with two columns of buttons. The first column is the starting province. Each of these buttons is labeled with the name of the province and the shield of its realm. All provinces controlled by the player as well as the provinces controlled by the player's allies are listed in this column. The second column is initially blank, but when a starting province is selected in the first column, all of your or your allies' provinces adjacent to the selected province are listed in the second. Clicking on one of these buttons selects the destination province of the new road. At the bottom of the window the cost of the road in gold is listed. The more rugged the terrain, the greater the cost to build the road. If you try to spend more gold than you have, the game announces "not enough gold."
^F02 
   The cost to build a road between any two provinces is equal to the sum of their terrain cost. Thus, to build a road between a forested province and a plains province is three gold bars (Forest: 2 + Plains: 1). These costs are:
Forest	2		Swamp		3
Hills	2		Plains		1
Low Mountains	2	High Mountains	4
Note:  You cannot build a road from high mountains to high mountains.
^F02 
   Clicking on the Build button spends the gold and creates the road. You can build additional roads if desired. Click the Done button when you are finished. See Troop Movement Cost.
^F02 
^F02 
^#148Contest Button
   The contest action is used to destroy another realm's Holdings. In order to contest another regent's holdings, you must have a holding in the same province. However, it does not have to be the same type of holding. All realms consider attempts to contest their holdings as a hostile act and quite often retaliate by contest actions of their own or by an outright declaration of war.
^F02 
   Successfully contesting a holding of level one or higher marks it as contested by placing a small crossed swords icon over the shield next to the holding's icon on the Anuire Realm Map. On the Taxation and Realm Maintenance screens, the crossed sword symbol denotes a contested province. Successfully contesting an already contested or zero level holding destroys it.
^F02 
   While a holding is contested it provides no gold or regency to its owner. The only way to remove this contested state is for its owner to conduct a successful Rule domain action on that particular holding.
^F02 
   The contest screen is divided into two columns of buttons. The first is a list of all the provinces in which you have holdings. Next to each name is the icon of the realm which actually controls the province. Once you have selected the province where you wish to contest a holding, the second column appears. This column of buttons shows all the foreign holdings existing in the target province. Each button is marked with the type of holding and the controlling realm.
^F02 
   This action costs one regency point, with the option to spend more to raise the chance of success. By expending extra regency points you can raise or reset the success chance. To do this, click on the Plus or Minus button next to the success number.
^F02 
   The total cost of the action is kept track of at the bottom of the screen. When you have finished Modifying Your Success chance, click on the Roll button to resolve the attempt. At this time the other regent may wish to modify your success with his or her own regency. If so, you are informed by an audio cue stating, "success modified by opponent," and are given the chance to modify your success again before rolling. This process may occur several times before both regents cease to modify their rolls. When you are finished with this action, click on the Done button, and you'll return to the main domain actions menu. At any time up until the roll has been successfully made, this action may be aborted with no expenditure of regency by using the Cancel button.
^F02 
   If another realm is contesting a holding that you own in their province, a screen appears where you can spend regency to lower the chances of that event happening.
^F02 
^F02 
^#149Create Holding Button
   A Holding is one form of asset, similar to having a rental property in today's world. The holding pays you income each domain turn, and you, in turn, maintain and protect it from takeover. There are four types of holdings:  Law, Guild, Temple, or Source Holdings.
^F02 
   The Create Holding action is used to create a zero level Holding in a province. You must create a Guild Holding to create a Trade Route. Most realms view the creation of holdings inside provinces they control to be an intrusion into their affairs, and this can affect Diplomacy. Selecting this action displays a window with two rows of buttons labeled with the names and shields of the other realms in the game.
^F02 
   Clicking on a Realm button displays a screen of buttons marked with the names of all the provinces in the selected realm. When you click on a province, a column of four buttons will appear on the right. Click on the type of holding, (law, guild, temple, or source) that you wish to create. If you already have a holding in the province, the appropriate holding button will be dimmed and inaccessible.
^F02 
   Below this column is the success number required to create the holding. By expending regency points you can raise or reset your chance of success. Click on the Plus or Minus button next to the success number to spend regency points.
^F02 
   The total cost of the action is calculated at the bottom of the window. After you have modified your success with Regency, other regents may do the same to contest your action. If so, you are given a chance to modify your success again. This cycle may occur several times until both regents have stopped modifying their chances.
^F02 
   When you are finished, click Roll a final time, then click on the Done button to take you back to the Domain Actions screen. At any time before the roll has been successfully made, this action may be aborted with no expenditure of regency or gold by using the Cancel button.
^F02 
^F02 
^#150Declare War Button
   War is declared when you want to conquer, occupy and invest in a province, force passage for your troop units, or to pillage a province. When you declare war on a realm, they do not automatically go to war with you. You may do battle and defend within your own territory, but you cannot counterattack into foreign provinces without first declaring war yourself. War only lasts for the duration of the Domain Turn in which it is declared. This is why war may not be declared as your third and last action, as you would get no opportunity to do anything before reports. To continue a war you must use a declare war action every domain turn. Declaring war on an allied realm can break that alliance and lower your diplomacy rating.
^F02 
   Once the declare war action is selected, a screen appears containing two columns of buttons listing all the unconquered realms. Realms that lose their last province are destroyed, their ports and castles become those of the conqueror, and the realm is removed from the declare war, diplomacy, and reports screens.
^F02 
   Select the realm you wish to declare war against, and left-click on it. Click on the Done button after it becomes highlighted. War is declared, and your troop units may now move freely into that realm's provinces. A large set of crossed red swords appears on the map, centered halfway between the two capitals. Wars declared against non-adjacent enemies do not cause this map icon to appear.
^F02 
^F02 
^#223Effects of War
   Troops may now enter the provinces of the realm you are at war with. All other movement rules are still in effect. Gold expenditure for Troop Movement takes place at the same rates. If an enemy flees to an allied realm, you cannot follow without declaring war on that realm as well. Battles occur when you move a troop unit or units into a province occupied by enemy troop units or they move into a province you occupy. Once a force has encountered enemy troop units, your units are engaged and may no longer continue moving. One domain turn must elapse before commanding a battle and having your units fight. A dialog box appears asking whether you want to command a battle. If you select yes, you go into battle. If you select no, the computer quickly determines the outcome of the encounter and shows you the results within a pop-up dialog box without going into battle mode. See The Battle Result Report.
^F02 
   The pop-up displays the victor of the conflict, a summary of your losses, and how many enemy units you destroyed in the battle. If you lost the battle, your surviving units retreat into an adjacent province. The destination of the retreat must be a legal move: into a province you own, an ally's province, or a province of the realm with whom you are at war. Troop units that are not able to make a legal retreat are destroyed. Retreating troops from battles lost by your opponent are treated in the same manner. Victory of a battle allows your troops to Occupy that province.
^F02 
   You may pillage occupied provinces or do Investiture if you occupy that province from the third domain action of a domain turn to the first domain action of the succeeding turn without being attacked by enemy forces. Occupying units may also neutralize castles and put them under siege.
^F02 
   Realms that have a full alliance or are your vassals through diplomacy and who are also adjacent to the realm you are fighting, declare war. If a full ally is not adjacent, they'll give help where they can, such as seizing holdings that belong to the opponent. The extent of the military and gold support of your allies varies by realm and situation.
^F02 
^F02 
^#151Diplomacy Button
^F02 
The Need for Diplomacy
   Diplomacy is used to create alliances between realms, to place powerful lieutenants in vassalage to you, or to request provinces, holdings, and gold, in payment or tribute. Alliances allow your troops to move freely through your ally's territory if a realm adjacent to you declares war on you. The provinces of your allies also give you points towards winning the game.
^F02 
The non-landed guilds and temple networks are led by powerful lieutenants whom you can ally with or place in vassalage. If one becomes your vassal, you control and collect revenue from their holdings, can use them to complete Lieutenant Actions, and take them into Battle or Adventures. Many Domain Actions can affect or break alliances, the foremost being a declaration of war.
^F02 
Choosing which Realm
   Left-click on the realm with which you want to have diplomacy. The color of the realm name gives you information about their status. Right-click on the realm name to view the Status display of the realm's regent or head. 
Realm Color	Status
	Red 	At War
	Orange	Dislike
	Green	Permissive Allies
	Blue	Full Allies
	Purple	Vassals
	Black	Neutrals
   The number shows their reaction to you. The higher the number, the better.
^F02 
^F02 
Petitions, Offers, and Demands
   The name of the realm and regent you are conducting diplomacy with is shown at the top of the second screen. Clicking on the button with the realm name returns you to the first screen. Below is a list of the petitions, demands, and offers you can choose from, while the text under these three sections tells you what the other regent's base reaction percentage to you is, adjusted by both your alignments and your court. Next to the list of petitions is a column listing the minimum percentages necessary for each type of alliance and the percentage modifiers to demands and offers. Lower still, your success chance, the +/- buttons to modify success with regency, and the total cost in gold bars and regency are found. Lastly, the Cancel button returns you to the Domain Action screen without a loss in regency or gold. The Roll button lets you roll for your success, and the Done button completes the diplomatic action.
^F02 
   First select which type of alliance you want or select to request gold. Red text near the bottom of the screen tells you what percentage must be met before your petition is considered. Next, select the demands and offers you wish to make. For each gold bar demanded your base percentage goes down by 3%, each gold bar offered improves this by 2%. Each gold bar demanded in tribute lowers your base percentage chance by 10%, while each one offered in tribute raises it by 5%. Demanding or offering provinces or holdings deteriorates or improves your base chance greatly and takes you to the third screen.
^F02 
^F02 
Completing Diplomacy
   The top of the screen again displays the name of the realm and regent with whom you are conducting diplomacy. Once again, clicking on the button returns you the first realm screen. Below this, you are reminded whether a province or holding is being offered or demanded and the modifier attached to that action. Clicking on the check-mark next to the offer/demand text returns you to the second petitions, offers, and demands screen. Select the province you wish to offer/demand or the province which contains the holding you want. The color of the province name denotes the Province Loyalty. Offers show all the provinces you own, demands show all the provinces owned by the target realm of the diplomatic action. If the list of provinces is too long for the page, you'll see a Next Page button. Selecting this shows you the rest of the provinces and provides a Previous Page button to return to the beginning of the list. If you offered or demanded a holding, a list of holdings in that province now appears in the right column. Selecting a holding returns you to the petitions, demands, and offers screen where the selected province or holding is shown in the right column. You may cancel any petitions, offer, or demands at any time prior to rolling for success by simply unchecking the appropriate box.
^F02 
   When you have met the minimum percentage chance, the Roll button becomes highlighted, your success number shows, and the +/- buttons for Modifying Success Rolls become active. When you have finished modifying your success roll with regency, click the Roll button. After your success is determined, click Done to return to the Domain Action screen. On all three diplomacy screens the Cancel button returns you to the domain action screen with no loss of gold or regency.
^F02 
^F02 
^#152Espionage Button
^F02 
   The espionage action allows you to spy on enemy units or assassinate a regent, lieutenant, or unit. This action does reveals hidden units. This action can affect an existing alliance with the target realm of the espionage action. Thieves may do one espionage action per domain turn as a free action. There are three different screens that help you complete espionage. 
^F02 
   The first screen shows a list of all the realms you can choose from as the target of espionage. Selecting a realm brings you to the second screen where you need to select one of the provinces owned by the target realm. If you wish to return to the realm list, click on the button with the realm's name found at the top left of the screen. If there are too many provinces to list on this screen, a Next Page button takes you the list of remaining provinces, and a Previous Page button brings you back. To the right of the province list is information on the target realm's treasury, income, and regency.
^F02 
   After selecting a realm, you must select to spy on units or assassinate. Spying on units makes the success number appear and the +/- buttons for Modifying Success Rolls. After modifying your success, click the Roll button and all non-hidden units in that province are listed. Selecting the "assassinate" option displays a list of units, regent, and lieutenants within the province, if any. Select a name and the success number and +/- buttons appear. Modify with regency if desired and then click Roll. Either option may be modified by the target realm with regency. You can modify the roll again if this occurs. This cycle continues until the target realm stops modifying the success roll. Click Roll a final time to see the results of the espionage action and Done to return you to the Domain Action screen. Using the Cancel button at any time returns you to the domain action screen with no loss of gold or regency.

^#147Forge Ley Line Button
   Forging a ley line connects a source holding in one province with a source holding in another. The cost to build a ley line is based on the number of provinces crossed by the ley line. You must own the holdings in both provinces to be connected by the ley line. All source holdings so linked are considered to have the source level of the highest level source holding in the chain, but only in regard to realm spells. The source level values are not added. If several are connected they all take the highest source in the chain as their source level in respect to realm spells. Only wizards may forge ley lines. 
^F02 
   All the provinces that contain your source holdings, not only provinces you own, are listed on the left. Select a start province for the ley line by clicking on a province. The same list minus the start province you chose appears on the right side of the screen. Select one of these as an end province for the ley line. This displays the success number and the +/- buttons so you can Modify Success using regency, if creating the ley line is not a Lieutenant Action. If one of the holdings connected is in a province belonging to another realm, the roll may be adjusted by the target realm. When you have finished Modifying Your Success chance, click on the Roll button to resolve the attempt. At this time the other regent may wish to modify your success with his or her own regency. If so, you are informed by an audio cue stating, "success modified by opponent," and are given the chance to modify your success again before rolling. This process may occur several times before both regents cease to modify their rolls. When you are finished with this action, click on the Done button to return to the domain actions menu. At any time up until the roll has been successfully made, this action may be aborted with no expenditure of regency or gold by using the Cancel button. The cost in Gold Bars and Regency is shown at the bottom of the screen. 
^F02 
^F02 
^#153Fortify Button
   The fortify action builds castles in your provinces. You are presented with a list of provinces that you own, the color relating to the province loyalty. There are three columns to the right of the province names. The Existing Castles column shows the level of castles that have already been built or are in the process of being built. In the desired level column you can use the +/- buttons to set the level of the castle you want built. The maximum level of the castle is limited to the civilization level of the province. As many provinces as desired can be fortified at one time. The castle is built one level at a time at a cost of eight gold bars per level. How much money per turn is spent on a castle's construction is determined randomly, ranging between one and six gold bars per turn. Every time eight gold bars have been spent a new level is added to the castle. Castles can also be built with the wizard realm spell, Stronghold. Castles are automatic to build; there is no success roll. Click Done to build the castle or Cancel to return to the Domain Action screen.
^F02 
^F02 
^#154Hold Action Button
   A hold action lets you skip a turn. If you are waiting for an event or have no money or regency, you can pass as many times as you like. Click Done to complete the action or Cancel to abort.
^F02 
^F02 
^#155Investiture Button
   After you have moved your troops into an enemy's realm, and they have suppressed the local law and populace, you can enact the magical ritual of investiture to make that province your own.
To invest a province:
   1.	It must first be clear of all enemy troops.
   2.	The castle, if any, must be neutralized.
   3.	The province must be occupied from the third domain action of a turn until the first domain action of the next Domain Turn without being attacked by enemy units.
	To do this, a number of army units (equal to the sum of the province level and the law level) must occupy that province over the third action and the first domain action of the next domain turn. If this has been accomplished, the shield icon for that province shows a soldier's silhouette in the corner on the taxation screen. 
^F02 
   When you are able to invest a province, its name appears on the investiture screen. Click on the province you wish to choose. If you succeed, the province is added to your country to rule as your own, and boundaries on the map change to reflect investery. The holdings in that province continue to belong to its original owner unless the province was the last province that realm controlled. For this, like most other domain actions, the success number can be modified with regency to alter the success chance. Other regents may also modify success. After adjustments are concluded, click the Roll button to resolve the action, and click Done to return to the domain action screen.
^F02 
^F02 
^#156Lieutenant Button
   A list of available lieutenants is displayed with their class and level. If you right-click on a name, the Character Status screen appears. To hire a lieutenant and to equip him using the Prepare Magic dialog box, left-click on the name and on Done to accept. The cost of a lieutenant is the level of the character in gold bars. This is a one time cost; lieutenants do not require to be paid in payroll on the Realm Maintenance screen. Each lieutenant appears joined on the Anuire realm map with your regent and comes with his or her own unit of bodyguards. Your lieutenants can be taken on adventures. 
^F02 
^F02 
^#157Lieutenant Action Button
   Once in every three month period, your lieutenant can carry out one domain action for you. This is considered a Free Action. The Domain Actions that can be performed by lieutenant action are Adventure, Agitate, Create Holding, Diplomacy, Espionage, Forge Ley Line, Fortify, Realm Spell, Rule, and Trade Route. The only other limitation to the actions the lieutenant can perform is that he cannot modify the success using regency, since lieutenants have no regency. Note, that in diplomacy the alignment of the lieutenant is the modifier for reaction. This can be very helpful. Forge Ley Line is only available to wizard lieutenants, and Cast Realm Spell is only available to Wizards and Priests. After selecting a lieutenant, click Done to select that character as the one you want. Then, select the domain action normally.
^F02 
^F02 
^#158Muster Button
   Muster is a Free Action and may be done as many times during the domain turn as desired. This is only limited by your treasury. Remember that any troop units mustered must be paid for every domain turn on the Payroll screen. When the muster screen first appears you see a list of all the provinces you own. Clicking on a province brings up a column on the right side of the screen listing the types of troops available for muster in that province. The Unit Types available are dependent on the level of the province as shown in the table below. Note:  Right-click on the unit type to see their battle card. 
^F02 
   You may only muster a total number of units equal to the Province Level. The +/- buttons to the right of the units list are used to select the number and type of troops you want to muster. The total cost in gold bars is tallied near the bottom of the screen. If you try to spend more gold than you have in your treasury a voice states, "Not enough gold." You may want to look in the Army Battles section before mustering troops. After you have selected the units you wish to muster, click the Muster button, and then click Done. You may Cancel to return to the domain action screen without a loss of gold bars.

^#159Realm Spell Button
^F02 
   Only spellcasting regents may cast Realm Spells. These include Wizards, Priests, Bards, and high-level Rangers and Paladins. Priest and wizard lieutenants can cast realm spells as a Lieutenant Action. All wizard realm spells require a minimum Source Holding level to cast them. All priest realm spells require a minimum Temple Holding level to cast them. If a source or temple level is not high enough to cast the spell, you may use the domain action Rule to raise the holding level or the domain action Forge Ley Line to connect the low level source to a higher one you own in another province. 
^F02 
   At the top of the screen there is a list of the realms you have source or temple holdings in. Select a realm by clicking the appropriate button. If you wish to return to the list of realms simply click on the button with the chosen realm's name on it. Next, a list of provinces within that realm that contain source or temple holdings you own appears. Select the province you wish to cast the realm spell in. You have the option of returning to the list of provinces if you click on the button with the province name. If there are currently any other realm spells in effect within that province, information on those spells is shown to the right of the province name and just above the total of gold bars and Regency costs. A list of the realm spells your chosen priest or wizard knows is shown below the selected province. Spell buttons that are grayed-out denote a source or temple holding of insufficient level to cast the spell. Some spells merely require clicking the Done button to complete them, while others may require you to Modify Success with gold or regency. Some spells may give you the option of picking other provinces that the spell affects. Select a spell and click Done after making adjustments to the roll. You may cancel with no loss of regency or gold any time prior to selecting the Roll button.
^F02 
^F02 
^#160Rule Button
   Ruling your provinces and holdings is the only way to raise their level and thus the regency and gold your realm generates. You cannot rule a province until you own it. Obtaining more provinces is done through the domain action, Investiture. Creating holdings is done with the domain action, Create Holding. The maximum province and holding level you can rule to is ten. Only one province can be ruled during one domain action, but any number of holdings may be ruled. You are limited only by the amount of regency and gold you possess. Ruling a province or a holding raises it by one level.
^F02 
   The screen has a list of provinces you own and have holdings in. If this list scrolls off the page a Next Page button at the bottom of the screen takes you to the rest of the list. A Previous Page button brings you back. Provinces you own are colored appropriately to their province loyalty; provinces you have holdings in are colored in black.
^F02 
   The first column lists the province level while the next four columns list the Law Holdings, Guild Holdings, Temple Holdings, and Source Holdings. Any button that is highlighted may be selected, making the +/- buttons available to Modify Success Rolls with regency. After selecting and modifying the success numbers click the Roll button to resolve your attempt. Click Done to return to the domain action menu after the rolls have been made. You may select Cancel and return to the domain action screen any time prior to selecting the Roll button. Note:  If there are no buttons, then the holdings cannot be ruled because either the province is already at its maximum or some other realm has a holding there.
^F02 
^F02 
^#133Creating a Trade Route
   When a trade route is created, you must select a start province and an end province by clicking on available provinces listed on the Trade Route domain action screen. You must fulfill the following criteria before creating the trade route:
	A trade route must be established between two provinces of different terrain types.
	Trade routes cannot be created until a road has been built between the two provinces, using the Build Road domain action.
	A Guild Holding must be created in the start province to be linked by the trade route, using the Create Holding domain action.
^F02 
   The trade route screen lists these criteria if you do not currently fulfill them. 
^F02 
   Creation of a trade route costs one GB and one RP. Your success number to create the trade route is improved by the current level of the regent's guild holding. The higher the level of the guild holding, the better your chance to create the trade route. To improve your chance of success you may spend Regency points by clicking on the +/- buttons near the bottom of the screen and then clicking the Roll button. At this time the creation of your trade route may be contested by another realm if they have guild or law holdings in the start province. If so, you may be asked to modify the success chance with regency, and click roll again. Complete the creation of the trade route by clicking the Done button when it becomes highlighted. See Domain Actions.
^F02 
^#134Income from Trade Routes
^F02 
   To determine the income from a trade route, add the province levels of the two provinces linked by the route, and divide by two. The result reflects the number of gold bars added to the regent's treasury. For example, a trade route between a province(2) and a province(6) nets the owner four GB (gold bars) per turn (2 + 6 = 8 and 8 divided by 2 = 4). In addition, thief regents who control trade routes collect regency points equal to the gold bars generated by the trade route. 
^F02 
^#135Additional Trade Route Information
   Provinces of level one to three are limited to one trade route; level four to six provinces can support two trade routes; level seven to nine provinces can support three.
If a guild holding that was used as the start province to create a trade route is destroyed by an enemy using the domain action Contest, the trade route is also destroyed. If a guild holding used as the start province to create a trade route is given away in diplomacy, the trade route and its revenue are also given to the same realm.
^F02

Casting spells and using magic items is covered in more detail under Spells.
^F02 
^F02 
^#194Inventory Information Windows
   The information box at the top contains your character's name. Items or spells in inventory are found in the center information window. To highlight an item or spell to Use, Drop, or Give, click on the text name.

^#201^F06B^F02LOOD ABILITIES BUTTON
^F02 
   Blood abilities are innate powers derived from a character's Bloodline Strength. Blood abilities can only be Used, not Dropped or Given. You are informed by a dialog box when you try to use a blood ability that is always in effect. Some blood abilities are only in effect on the Realm level. However, these blood abilities are always in effect at that level and do not require the Use button.
^F02 
   Blood abilities cannot be transferred to the hot boxes but can be highlighted to display their text descriptions in the lower informational window. See Blood Abilities.
^F02 
^F02 
^#195Use Button
   When you click on the Use button, the highlighted item in the center informational window immediately becomes activated. Some items are always being used or active, and a dialog box appears to inform you in this case. When the player uses an item or casts a spell, it brings up a dialog box; the player will always be returned to the Adventure Screen after clicking OK to clear the dialog box.
^F02 
   Using some Magic Items and Spells may bring up an additional dialog box telling you that the item or spell is now in effect. Clicking the OK button takes you back to either the Inventory screen or the Adventure screen. Mundane items, such as plates or vases, cannot be used. If you want to use the item or spell directly from the adventure screen rather than through the inventory screen, you must click on the item's or spell's icon to place it in one of the six hot boxes.
^F02 
^#193Give Button
   Selecting the Give button after highlighting an item brings up a screen asking which member of your party you want to give the item to. Select a character, and click OK.
^F02 
^#196Drop Button
   The Drop button eliminates the highlighted item from the character's inventory and places it in the adventure location. Normally, all items dropped may be picked up again by any character. When a character dies, all of the items are dropped from his inventory.
^F02 
^#202Hot Boxes
   Memorized spells, magic and mundane items can be placed for quick use in the six square hot boxes by left-clicking on the spell or item's icon in the center information window and then clicking inside the hot box below or hitting the keyboard number. Left-clicking on an icon in a hot box removes it and places it back in the list. This can only be done while in the Inventory screen. From the Adventure screen, items and spells in the hot boxes can be used immediately without accessing the Inventory screen.
^F02 
^#203Status Button
   The Status button brings up the Character Status Screen.
^F02 
^#204Done Button
   This button returns you to the Adventuring screen after completing any actions involving your inventory items.
^F02 
^#1793D Adventure Viewing Screen
   The default camera view (F9) is a first-person range of vision. Use the arrow keys to move and look around, the space bar to manipulate doors, levers, switches, etc., and the left mouse button to pick up items. You cannot pick up items while engaged in combat.
^F02 
   If you need to see more of the screen, push the '^F11]^F02' key. This enlarges the screen in stages until it fills the entire screen. To shrink the screen, use '^F11[^F02' key. This puts the party's status bars back into the display. On slower computers, shrinking the screen also increases the program's speed. These and other keys and buttons are explained under Adventure Quick Keys and Buttons.
^F02 
   Unless you have an alliance with the owner of the castle, most dungeons are hostile, and any creature you encounter is going to attack. If you are adventuring in an ally's castle, the guards will ignore you until you pick something up. Alliance or not, monsters always attack.
^F02

   Right-click on a portrait to bring up the inventory box. Right-click anywhere on the status bar to display the status box.
   Left-clicking on any portrait activates that character. That character then performs future actions.
^F02 
^#183   Adventure Health Bar
   The health bar shows your current hit points as a percentage of your original hit points when healthy. Left-clicking on the health bar brings up the Character Inventory screen.
^F02 
^#184   Adventure Message Box
   The message box shows information about your character; who has been attacked, how much damage was done, and what number on a twenty-sided die or percentage chance of success is necessary to hit the opponent. This is also covered in Armor Class. For more information, see Modifying Success Rolls and THAC0.
^F02 
^#186   Attack/Defend Mode
   In real-time combat, you can choose to use one of two attack modes or to defend. Not all characters have two attack modes and the Defend button becomes the Fall Back button when you are in turn-based combat mode. More information on these can be found under Adventure Settings, Combat and Spell Use, and Quick Keys and Buttons.
^F02 
^#182Adventure Hot Boxes
   Your hot boxes are a quick link to spells or magic items. Press the number of the box or left-click to activate that item or spell. The box is replenished if you have more of that spell or item remaining, otherwise it becomes empty. Putting objects into your hot boxes is discussed in the Inventory section.

^#181Combat Camera Views
   These following camera moves are relative to the direction that your characters and foes are facing. Sometimes the camera cannot move to the location indicated but finds the closest place it can. For example, 
   F5	Moves the camera behind your character and looking towards the enemy.
   F6	Moves the camera behind your foe and looking at your character.
   F7	Moves the camera to the right side of your character.
   F8	Moves the camera to the left side of your character.
   F9	This first-person view moves the camera to look out of the character's eyes. It's very useful for casting spells or when using target items. If a spell caster casts a spell, you can tab through the characters to look out of other party members' eyes before casting. Be careful of direct line spells and items, because they hit anything in their path.
^F02 
^F02 
Movement
   Up Arrow	This key moves the party forward in its direction. Holding down the Shift key and the up arrow makes the party run forward.
   Down Arrow	This moves the party backwards. Holding the Shift key down with the down arrow makes the party run backwards.
   Left and Right Arrows	These turn the character to the left or right respectively. 
   A	This causes the party to jump or ascend if the party is flying or levitating. This key can be used with the arrow movement keys to jump in a designated direction.
   Z	This button changes the characters in the party from an upright to a crouching position. This can also be used in conjunction with any of the arrow movement keys. The party descends if they were flying or levitating.
   Up Arrow + Shift + A key	Allows the character to make a long jump while running
   Insert	Side step to the left.
   Delete	Side step to the right.
   Page Up	Look up.
   Page Down	Look down.
^F02 
Interaction
   Space Bar	Use this key to manipulate objects that cannot be picked up, i.e. doors, switches, and sliding panels. To do this, face the item, move in closer, and press the space bar.
^F02 
   Mouse	In addition to pushing buttons aiming target spells, and selecting characters, the mouse is used to pick up items. Left-click the mouse on the item to be picked up, and it is placed into the active character's inventory. To identify an item before picking it up, right-click on the item and a dialog box appears displaying the name of the selected item. There is a distance limit so you may have to move closer. The active character cannot pick up items while engaged in combat.
^F02 
   Tab	The Tab key cycles to the next member of your party. As the character is activated, it is highlighted. Note that only one character can be activated at a time.
^F02 
^F02 
Hot Boxes	Items in your hot boxes can be used by pressing the keys from one through six that correspond to the associated hot box. This is a short cut for opening the inventory box, selecting a spell or item, and casting or using the item.
   X	Combat attack 1. For more information see Combat and Spell Use.
Shift X	Quick Attack 1
   C	Combat attack 2. For more information see Combat and Spell Use.
Shift C	Quick Attack 2
   D	Defend key. For more information see Combat and Spell Use.
   0 (zero)	The 0 key toggles the real-time combat mode between On and Off. If an attacker is still in range, combat mode starts again immediately. This key is useful when being attacked from around a corner or upon entering a room. If you are in combat and no one seems to be taking any damage, press zero and move a little closer to the opponent. This may take a couple of repetitions because the wall acts as a shield, and neither character can quite hit the other.
^F02 
^#187Exit Adventure Button
   This button ends the adventure, and returns the party to the realm. If you have succeeded, you'll receive experience points for completing the quest, and a victory screen will appear. If not successful, the defeat screen appears and you return to the realm. Regardless of the outcome, your hit points reset, and any mundane non-magical items are cashed in for gold and added to your treasury.
^F02 
^#178Party Retreat
   You must be engaged in combat to use this button. It disengages the entire party from a fight and moves the party back about 100 feet on its previous path. You cannot retreat into pits or up walls. 
^F02 
^#188Change Leader
   Use the Tab key to cycle through and highlight the various characters in your party. Click on the Change Leader button, and the active character then becomes the new leader. If the current leader is the highlighted character, then nothing happens. 
^F02 
   The Change Leader button is not available when engaged in combat. 
^F02 
^#189Change View
   This toggles the camera's view from the perspective of the leader to just behind the leader.
^F02 
^#190Adventure Map
   The first time this button is pressed, a two-dimensional map appears in the lower right corner. Click the button a second time, and the map fills the screen. Note:  When the map is at its larger size, your party cannot move. Click the button a third time, and the map is deleted from the screen. 
^F02 
   Any time the map is displayed, the + and - keys zoom in and out on the map.
^F02 
^#191Adventure Done Button
   This button only appears when the combat mode has been set to RPG. See the combat mode setting in Adventure Settings on the Options menu to change from real-time to turn-based (RPG) combat mode. In turn-based combat, select the combat action for your character, and click the Done button. That selected combat action will then be executed.
^F02 
   Click on the Exit Adventure button when you have found the treasure that the site holds and wish to proceed to the next action in your domain turn.
^F02 
^F02 
^#173Tricks, Traps, and Puzzles
   In addition to monsters and guards, adventures are frequently filled with puzzles, traps, secret doors and other deceptive problems. Here are some of the things you may run into.
^F02 
   Fake Walls	Fake walls are illusive. You can simply walk through them.
^F02 
   Secret Doors	These hidden doors are opened just like a normal door, by pressing the space bar or using a switch or lever.
   Pits	By themselves, pits are not very dangerous unless they are very deep. However, many are filled with lava, acid, or a monster. You can jump over most of them, but flying is better if you have that option.
^F02 
   Crushing Ceilings	These traps were created by some twisted mind as the ultimate theft prevention device. The party steps on a trigger, and the ceiling starts lowering. To avoid disaster, you'll not only need to move fast enough to get the leader through but the rest of your party as well. Slow footed adventurers are dead, period! There is no saving throw, no armor protection, and no spell to save you. Listen for the distinct sound of machinery as a clue.
^F02 
   Switches, Levers, and Trip Lines	Throughout any dungeon, you will undoubtedly run across one of these. The results can vary from opening a door to setting off a trap. In any case, trip lines are activated when you walk across them, and switches or levers are manipulated by pressing the space bar.
^F02 
^F02 
^#174Combat and Spell Use
   Real-time Combat
   Combat occurs any time a monster or a hostile guard gets in range. The music changes, and unless the first person camera view is selected by pressing F9, the camera pulls back to display as much of the battle as possible. Choose the combat mode of the active character using the:
      X key for attack one,
      C key for attack two (if the character has one),
      D to have the character defend.
   If you hold down the Shift key and select an attack, you'll activate the fast attack mode. The Shift key works with the mouse as well. This gives you two attacks but at a -4 to hit penalty. Defending gives you a -4 Armor Class modifier thereby making it harder for your opponent to hit you. This penalty applies to only one opponent; all additional opponents engaged with this character do not suffer this penalty.
Some enemies have weaknesses to certain types of attacks. You can then use the Tab key to cycle through the characters in your party or click on their combat icons to set all of your party's combat modes. 
^F02 
   Turn-based Combat
   In turn-based combat, select each character's actions, then click the Done button on the bottom right. After the combatants have finished their actions, all animations cease, and you must choose their actions for the next turn. In turn-based combat the Defend button is replaced with the Fall Back button. Selecting the Fall Back option disengages the character from combat during that turn. However, be careful since your character is more susceptible to attacks at this time.
^F02 
   Note that you must keep selecting the Fall Back button during each turn. Otherwise, the character will 
default to Defend.
^F02 
^F02 
^#207Using Spells
   You can instantly use any spell or magic item appearing in your hot boxes by pressing its corresponding number key, one to six. Spells and magic items also can be selected by left-clicking on the inventory box. Moving the cursor over the hot boxes displays a short text description of the spell or item in the box.
Many spells and magic items require a designated target. A bull's-eye appears after casting or using this type of spell or item. Use the arrow keys to move the camera to get a better view of the target. When the target is in sight, left-click on it. If you are using a homing spell, it will hit the target. If it is a line-of-sight spell, it hits the first obstruction directly in front of the character. If your opponent is killed before he is targeted or if you simply want to abort the spell, right-click the mouse and the bull's-eye will disappear. Aborting does not expend the spell's or item's charge, so it is available for later use. See Memorizing Spells and Realm Spells.
^F02 
^F02 
^#175Adventure Completion
   When you click the Exit Adventure button, whether you've found the relic of power or not, your adventure is over, and you'll leave the adventure site. All of your mundane items are sold. That money plus what you found during the adventure are placed in your treasury. Each member of the party is awarded experience points for any creature that the party member killed personally. All characters receive equal experience points for finding the relic of power, and their hit points are restored. If you have completed the quest and found the Relic of Power, the adventure is removed from the adventure list.
^F02 
^F02 
^#176Experience Points
   Experience points represent the application of a character's skill in the course of completing a quest. The more obstacles that characters overcome, the more experience points they'll be awarded as they work toward the next level of that character class. In other words, a character's level represents a goal of accomplishment. As a character goes up in level, his hit points, skills, THAC0, saving throws, and the ability to cast spells if a spell caster all increase. Each higher level requires a larger number of experience points. Achieving third level is not as easy as it would be to achieve the second level twice.
^F02 
   In Birthright, adventure experience points are earned in the following manner:
      1 experience point for each gold piece found
      2 experience points for each gold piece found if your character is a thief
      10,000 - 40,000 points for completing a quest
      Varying points for killing monsters, etc. 
   In addition to adventures, a character can receive experience for realm actions. See Realm Experience Points Table.

^#059Commanding a Battle
   A battle occurs any time two armies of differing non-allied realms end a domain action in the same province. When a battle involves your units, you are shown the order of battle for the two sides, and given the option to command the battle or let the computer resolve the conflict.

^F02For the Battlefield
^F02 
   If you have chosen to command the battle and you have a character capable of magic, that character will automatically memorize any battle spell that he knows. The most destructive spells are placed in the hot boxes first, the order of which can be changed once you get to the battlefield (by accessing the Inventory screen). Note, however, that not all spells have effects on the battlefield. If there is an effect, it appears in the information box of the Inventory screen. 
^F02 
For an Adventure
^F02 
   This differs from the requirement to equip your party for an adventure. Spells must be memorized before entering an adventure site, as described in the sections Inventory and Memorizing Spells. 
^F02 
^F02 
^#062Choosing Terrain
   If you are the defender in a battle, choose what terrain you would like to defend. You always have four choices, but what four you may choose from depends on the terrain type of the province. To select a terrain, click on the picture of that terrain.
^F02 
The battlefields to choose from are:
^#63Open Field
   This battlefield has no distinguishable features. It is wide open with no obstructions to missiles or travel. This is a good choice for fast units, allowing them maximum maneuverability. Slow elite infantry and dwarves might want to avoid open fields as they offer no protection from missile fire or charges.
^F02 
^#065Rugged Hills
   Mountainous terrain exists to the left of this field with an impassable square in the center left. The mountains reduce all movement to one in all the squares on the left side of the field, and prevent the ability to charge. A mixed force could take advantage of this by stationing missiles to the left. After the enemy has committed to that side, flank the right with knights or cavalry.
^F02 
^#067Swampy Forest
   This is one of the densest of all the battlefields. With a swamp running through the center and forest and swamp upper left and lower right, this is the ultimate defensive ground against mounted units. The forest and swamp force them down to a movement of one plus they get no charge bonus. Slow units with good defensive numbers do well here as well as elves who are immune to movement restrictions.
^F02 
^#069Swampy Ground
   Swamp fills this battlefield from the upper left to the lower right, with an impassable mire in the center. This favors defense to the right, and attack to the left. In either case this is not particularly favorable to swift units.
^F02 
^#061River Bank through Forest
   This battlefield has a river running through its center, with forest upper right, and lower left. Movement through rivers is slowed considerably. The most affected units are mounted since their movement is more drastically reduced, and they do not get their charge bonus when attacking units in a river or forest. However it is excellent for missiles and magic using units as they get more missile attacks before hand to hand combat.
^F02 
^#072Partial Obstructions
   A wall divides this field with the center torn down to allow troops to pass. Either end is impassable. This makes a good choice for powerful but outnumbered units as the enemy must funnel through a small opening. Getting into the breach first and holding it is imperative, or the enemy simply swarms through and won't give your archers the mobility they need to avoid hand-to-hand conflict.
^F02 
^#064River Divides Field
   This battlefield has a river running through its center. Movement through rivers is slowed considerably. The most affected units are mounted since their movement is more drastically reduced, and they do not get their charge bonus when attacking units in a river. However, it is excellent for missiles and magic using units as they get more missile attacks before hand to hand combat begins.
^F02 
^#066Mountainous
   The center of this field is mountainous with only the outermost columns empty. The center reduces movement to one, making this favorable to a direct assault up the middle for elite infantry, dwarf infantry, or pikes, or to flanking the sides with cavalry taking advantage of their speed and missile capabilities. Be sure not to send knights or cavalry up the center as they get no charge or movement bonus.
^F02 
^#068Deep Waters
   Swamp covers the upper right and lower left of this field. These are a hindrance to swift units. Mounted units are more adversely affected since they do not get a charge bonus.
^F02 
^#070Partial Woods
   A little bit of forest dots the upper left and lower right corners of this field. Even so this is still mostly open with the entire center empty. Any army could make use of this field, but to use it to advantage requires careful attention to what troops use the forest. Your troops can be used to great effect when you've pushed the enemy to the back row or if the enemy has you pushed back. Remember any time movement is reduced, units cannot charge.
^F02 
^#071Heavily Wooded
   This is a battle for a strip of forest through the middle of the field. Archers can take great advantage of this since they cannot be charged. Infantry also can push forward before archers can establish a firing line. Elves do especially well here since they are not affected by the terrain.
^F02 
^F02 
^#073Unit Types and Strengths
   Many types of units can be created or hired by regents who qualify. Unless otherwise noted, regents who control domains composed entirely of holdings must convince a province ruler to allow them to raise an army. Only a few types of units can be raised without the consent of the province ruler.

^F02 
   Special units are nonhuman soldiers normally available only to nonhuman regents. Special troops cannot be mustered unless the regent is a member of the race or his domain includes cities, villages, or strongholds of the proper type. For example, an elf regent can muster units of elves; a regent whose domain includes a province infested with gnolls can muster gnoll units. Using evil humanoids as part of an army is considered an evil act and can have alignment repercussions.
^F02 
Unit Capabilities
   The capabilities of a unit are defined by six attributes plus special abilities, if any. As a unit takes damage, some attributes are reduced. The attributes are:
   Move		Defense
   Morale		Melee
   Charge		Missile
^F02 
^F02 
^#082Table of Unit Attributes and Special Abilities
^F02 
^#259Archers
   Troops skilled with the Anuirean longbow are greatly feared throughout Cerilia. Archers wear leather or padded armor and are equipped with a heavy melee weapon such as a battle axe or morning star in addition to their longbow.
^F02 
^#270Cavalry
   Anuirean cavalry are used for flank attacks, engaging light troops such as irregulars or militia, and harrying an enemy position. Most cavalrymen wear chain mail or brigandine armor and fight with lance, crossbow, and sword. Cavalry are also popular in Khinasi.
^F02 
^#269Infantry
   Anuirean infantry are used against archers and pikes; they are ineffective against mounted troops in the open field. Infantry are often armed with large, powerful weapons such as two-handed swords, halberds, or battle axes.
^F02 
^#268Elite Infantry
   The finest infantry units are equipped with splint, banded, or plate mail and are capable of enduring anything short of a heavy horse charge. Many Brecht realms command these units.
^F02 
^#267Irregulars
   Irregulars include skirmishers, barbarians, marauders, and the like. Their equipment varies widely and is often in poor condition. Rjurik, Vos, goblin, and gnoll formations are often irregulars.
^F02 
^#266Knights
   Mounted on heavy war horses and equipped with superior armor, a formation of knights can smash any defense except a line of archers or pikemen. A company of knights is composed of professional retainers as well as titled nobles. Vos varsk riders are considered knights because of their heavy armor and shock value.
^F02 
^#265Levies
   The weakest troops on the battlefields of Cerilia are local levies or militias. Poorly equipped and often poorly led, levies are used as ballista fodder by callous commanders. Wise generals use levies to relieve other army units of secondary duties such as home defense or protection of supply lines.
^F02 
^#264Mercenary Cavalry
   Some mercenary cavalry units nearly duplicate a company of knights, with their plate armor and heavy war horses. Most are light or medium cavalry with scale or chain armor, crossbows, and lances.
^F02 
^#263Mercenary Infantry
   Mercenary infantry, pikemen, and archers can all be hired at the same price. Naturally, a mercenary company's equipment can vary widely, but experienced mercenaries who are as well armed and well trained as elite infantry are not unusual.
^F02 
^#261Mercenary Irregulars
   The lowest grade of mercenaries, irregulars are often no more than marauders or warbands. They are of little use in a pitched battle, but can be effectively employed as raiders and skirmishers to tie down an enemy's defenses and force him to devote time and men to running the mercenaries to ground.
^F02 
^#262Pikemen
   The predominance of knights in Anuirean warfare ended with the introduction of pikes and longbows. Pikemen operate in dense masses, creating an impenetrable hedge of spear points. A column of pikemen on the move can strike an enemy line with unstoppable force. Front rank pikemen often wear plate mail or breastplates, while secondary echelons tend to forego armor.
^F02 
^#260Scouts
   Acting as skirmishers and infiltrators on the battlefield, scouts are extremely useful for gathering information. An army with a company of scouts automatically identifies enemy forces in adjacent provinces by displaying its icon on the map. This allows the general to bypass strong forces and seek contact with weaker ones if desired.
^F02 
^#274Dwarves
   Heavily armored, dwarf infantry or crossbowmen are highly regarded throughout Cerilia. They are occasionally available as mercenaries.
^F02 
^#273Elves
   Elves serve nonelven leaders only in the most unusual circumstances. They are never available as mercenaries. Elves are superior archers, and their cavalry are the swiftest and most dangerous in all Cerilia.
^F02 
^#271Goblins
   Goblins compensate for a lack of discipline with sheer numbers and bloodlust. They are commonly available as mercenaries in domains bordering goblin lands. Goblin cavalry are comprised of wolf riders.
^F02 
^#272Gnolls
   Wandering bands of gnolls are always ready to fight for gold and loot, and are commonly available as mercenaries.
^F02 
^#075Move
   Move represents how many squares a unit can traverse in a turn. This number is affected by terrain. Movement is not reduced by damage.
^F02 
^#078Morale
   Morale represents a unit's willingness to fight and ability to remain calm and focused in adversity. When enemy units are damaged, their morale determines how likely they are to remain on the field to continue to fight. Morale does not change with damage but determines reaction to damage.
^F02 
^#081Charge
   Some units, notably cavalry and knights, have a charge attribute. To be able to charge, the unit must be the one to start combat by moving into the square of the enemy. Some squares cannot be charged into unless a unit has a special ability. Some units such as pikemen cannot be charged. The charge bonus remains until the attacker is reduced to 75% of their original strength. 
^F02 
^#077Defense
   Defense is the ability of the unit to withstand and avoid damage. It is probably the most important attribute a unit can have. It is unaffected by damage.
^F02 
^#079Melee
   Melee is a unit's hand to hand fighting ability. Once units engage, it is melee and defense that determine the outcome. As a unit takes damage, its melee level drops.
^F02 
^#080Missile
   If a unit is equipped with ranged weapons, it has a missile rating. The range of a missile is one. This rating is reduced by damage. Also if a unit moves, it needs time to reorganize and reload before it can shoot again.

^#074Characters on the Battlefield
   Regents, lieutenants, wizards, and priests go into battle with their own body guards. Usually these consist of Elite Infantry, but some races prefer to use a different troop type. You can get information on any unit by right-clicking on the unit icon in either the battlefield grid, or the reserves box. Some Relics of Power and Blood Abilities need to be carried at least as far as the reserves to have any effect. When a battle involves your regent, you must be very careful. If your regent dies, the game is over.
^F02 
^F02 
^#076Magic on the Battlefield
   Some characters have the ability to cast magic on the battlefield. Each spell has its own effects. See Spells for details. To use magic, select a wizard with an enemy unit in range. In the Status box, there will be a list of available spells and what slot number they are in. The wizard will default to the first battlefield spell memorized. To change the choice of spell, either click on the spell name or press the corresponding number.
^F02 
   To target a spell, either select an enemy unit that is in red on the grid or move the cursor over the enemy units on the battlefield until the cursor changes to a lightning bolt. Clicking the mouse button will execute the spell. However, since spells can be blocked by stones, trees, walls, and other obstacles, choose targets carefully.
^F02 
   The higher the level of the character, the more magic he/she is likely to have. Some spells are usable on only some types of troops. For example, the Turn Undead spell kills skeletons. Be careful, magic cannot be cast when a unit is engaged as the character is too busy directing troops. 
^F02 
^#083Battle Interface
   The battle interface consists of three separate areas. Across the top half is the view port. This shows you the battle as it is happening. See Command View and 3D Camera Views for more information on changing the views. In the lower left is a multiple use information box. Usually this box contains your reserves, but can give information on total units for both sides or the status of an individual unit. See Reserves and Status for more information on these functions. The final area (and probably the most important) is the battlefield grid in the lower right.
^F02 
Firing Missiles
   Units with their missiles ready will have their name highlighted in yellow. To fire missiles, select the unit by clicking on it. Next, click on the targeted unit. If you are using the grid, the unit will be in red if they are a valid target. If you use the battlefield, the cursor will change to an arrow when you move it over a legitimate target.
^F02 
^#086Reserves
   This button displays your reserves in the left-hand info box. Units in the reserves cannot attack, or be attacked. To move a unit out of the reserves click on its icon, and then on a highlighted rectangle. If no lower half rectangles are available, you cannot bring units out. Putting units into the reserves is just the opposite, except units who are engaged cannot be moved.
^F02 
^#087Battle Status
   This button displays the status of the two armies on the field. It includes total to start, total on field, and total remaining. This is useful when trying to determine 4:1 majorities.
^F02 
^#089Retreat
   Retreat the battle. You are asked to confirm, but remember to pull off all the troops you want to save or they'll be lost on the battlefield. If you do not have a clear path to retreat, your armies will be destroyed even if they survive the battle.
^F02 
^#092Command (V)iew
   This pulls the camera back away from a single unit to view the field as a whole.
^F02 
^F02 
^#095Battlefield Grid Interface
Basic Information
   To control your units, use either the battlefield grid or the units themselves. Both are used in conjunction with the reserves box. The field is broken into 15 rectangles (three deep by five across). Each rectangle is divided in half (your side with the blue background and the enemy's side with the brown background). If a unit controls a rectangle, its icon will be bright. Each half of each square can have only one unit in it at a time, and no unit may move through a square occupied by two engaged units. If a unit moves into a square with a ready enemy unit, it becomes engaged in hand to hand combat. If the unit is not ready, enemy units can move in or out as they please.
^F02 
Moving Your Reserve Troops onto the Field
   To move your troops onto the field, click on one of the units shown in your reserves. Troops do not need to be bright to be moved out of the reserves, but they must have a grid rectangle open on the bottom row of the grid or field. After the unit has been selected, place it on the battlefield grid or directly onto the battlefield.
^F02 
Moving around the Battlefield
   To move a unit, select a bright unit by either clicking on the icon on the grid or on the unit on the battlefield. After the unit has been selected, the grid rectangles that are available will become highlighted. To move the unit to one of these, click inside the new rectangle. Alternately, move troops on the battlefield by moving the cursor in the direction you want to move the unit. When the unit changes to a pair of legs, left-click the mouse, and the unit will move in that direction. To move a unit to the reserves, select the unit as described above, and click the Reserve button. The unit must be on the back or top row to do this.
^F02 
   When moving units to engage the enemy, there are a few points to remember. The unit that is defending, (the one that was in the square first) gets the first attack. This gives a unit the advantage of holding its ground. The second is that to get the charge bonus, the unit must be the attacker. The unit holds that status until it is reduced to below 75% of its full strength. Therefore, a unit of less than 75% doesn't get a charge bonus even on the first turn. Also some terrain and some troops defeat the charge bonus.
^F02 
The Status Screen
   On the screen below, you can see the current status of your battle. The skeleton unit is currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the unit of pikemen. Notice that the health bar of one of your units now has yellow in it and another has red. Your yellow infantry unit and the skeleton's unit shows that their health rating has dropped below 50%; the red army unit of archers is in even worse shape with a health rating of less than 25%.  See Winning the Battle.

^#094Battlefield Concepts
   When combat occurs between units, whether melee, magic, or ranged, the attack is compared to the defense and then a result is determined. The possible outcomes are:
   Nothing:	No damage was done. It was a draw.
   Hit:	The attacker scored a hit and damaged the defender.
   Fall back:	The attacker scored a hit, the defender takes damage, and if a morale check is failed, then the defender is forced to move to an empty square nearby. If no squares are available, the unit is removed outright, is destroyed, and removed from play.
   Rout:	The attacker scored a hit, damage is done to the defender, and if the defender fails the morale check, it runs away to the reserves. If there are no empty squares adjacent, they are removed from play or destroyed.
   Destroy:	The attacker scored a major hit. The defender takes major damage.
^F02 
^#096Winning the Battle
   In addition to annihilating every enemy unit, you can win a battle by holding a four to one majority over your opponent. Note that on the battlefield, your reserve troops are not counted. The timer doesn't start until conflict has occurred for the first time, and starts over any time that majority is lost. Any defeated units still on the field are lost, and any units surviving in the reserves are forced to retreat. To count as a surviving unit, a unit must have, or have through combining with other units, a quarter or more of its original strength. Characters are the only exception to the one quarter survival rule. They survive if at least one other individual survives. When units retreat, they must have a clear path to a province of either their own, or an ally, that is free of all enemy troops, or they are destroyed.
