^W310     Half windswept moor and half pine forest, Dhoesone seems a land barely tamed. Despite its numerous logging camps, it remains home to elf tribes rumored to live among the pines. The people of the forest act secretive and keep to themselves for they can feel the guilds' presence among them. They know a wrong word can cause a "logging accident" for them or their families.  The people of the moor are shepherds, ever wary of natural dangers like peat bogs, ravines, Rjurik hunters, and roaming giants. This hardy breed, accustomed to the wind and harsh land, lives a life only vaguely Anuirean. Instead, these folk seek to emulate the nearby Rjuriks. Though insular, they will share their unique knowledge with travelers --for the right coin.
     The capital of Dhoesone is the city Sonnelind, located in the central province of the same name. Though not a big city, it's one of the largest north of the Stonecrowns. The products of Dhoesone include wool-based goods and lumber. The trade of animal hides thrives here, too.
