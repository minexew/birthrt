^W310     Your people resemble inhabitants of the Eastern Marches more than those of the Heartlands in temperament. Though it borders on three hostile domains, or perhaps because it does, Eliniens have an indomitable spirit. They stand resolute in their devotion to you, Your Majesty.
     Cattle and horses aplenty roam here, taking their sustenance from the grasslands bordering on Coeranys and Mhoried. Some of the hills rising and falling throughout the country conceal ancient elven fortresses whose secrets have yet to be unlocked. The swamp Hope's Demise squats on the kingdom's eastern border, hiding hydras and other monsters no one can guess at, as well as the occasional criminal fleeing the kingdom of Coeranys or the patriarch's gentle but firm laws. To the north lies the Sielwode, and woe betide the fool who wanders in sight of its unpredictable elves. Elinie remains unique and beloved of its people.
