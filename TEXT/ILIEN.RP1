^W310     We have little in the way of an army, but all are dedicated to your majesty's cause.  We stand ready with 2 units of pikemen.
     As you are aware, the Gorgon threatens to conquer all of Anuire.  Since we are a smaller realm, I urge you to choose wisely your course of action.  Through alliances with your neighbors will you best succeed; diplomacy and intrigue are your better paths than war. Tread carefully on the road to your glorious destiny.
