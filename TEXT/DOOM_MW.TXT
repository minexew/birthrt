^F02^W304In the heart of a small, but treacherous, range of mountains in northern Five Peaks stands a ruined tower atop one mountain. Few locals ever venture close to this haunted site, for it is quite well-known that any who are about the ruins after dark are rarely seen again by the light of day. All that is certain about the mysterious tower's history is that it was built before the final battle of the gods to be the hunting residence of a powerful official from the Imperial capital. What the locals do not know, but I have been able to discover, is that the original building still holds the Hammer of Thunder, and that its opulent halls are now home to evil and powerful creatures, obviously there to find the Hammer. We should try to recover the Hammer of Thunder before any powerful force of evil can make use of this mighty weapon.
