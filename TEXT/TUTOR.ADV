^F02^W304My liege, it is my unfortunate duty to inform you of a cowardly and villainous assault on our border fortress of Ruidewash Keep. A group of goblins, probably with the help of that dishonorable wretch Entier Gladanil who calls himself regent in Cariele, has taken the keep and dispensed with our troops. We dare not send in the army as they have taken possession of the Regalia of Empire and may slip out with it in the confusion of a retreat. I have learned, however, that they regularly go on raids in the nearby countryside, leaving only a minimal contingent. If a small band were to infiltrate during one of their outings, the relic could be recovered, making it a simple matter for the army to dispatch the raiders.
