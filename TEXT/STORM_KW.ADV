^W310Khorien, the wizard of Taeghas, has turned his back on affairs of state, preferring instead to research his magic and blindly accept the advice of his councilors. None respect him, nor are they willing to come to his aid. But, he has accumulated much wealth and items of magic within his stronghold of Stormpoint. In spite of his magic artifacts and mighty fortress, he is weak and ripe for picking. I believe we should visit this fool and relieve him of the weight of magic that surely burdens him unnecessarily.
