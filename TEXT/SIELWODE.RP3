^W310     Greetings, elven Majesty, it is a pleasure to serve you.  As the military advisor said, there has been suspicious activity within the ranks of the Gorgon's forces.  Their intent is as of yet unclear, but undoubtedly they are planning something tremendous.
     Our only full ally is Tuarhievel, the other elven kingdom in Anuire. Since they have a full alliance with Dhoesone, their human neighbors to the east, we may be able to set up trade relations with them both.
