^W310   Our borders are secure, Majesty. With the natural defenses provided by our Seamist Mountains, we are well shielded from invaders. Our vassalage to the Prince of Avanil is the major impediment to your ambitions. We must find some way to break with our liege lord without provoking open war, at least not until we are truly ready.
   Our scouts are ready to aid you in this noble endeavor, Your Majesty.
