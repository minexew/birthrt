^F02^W304Haes is the second oldest city in all Tuornen and serves as the domain's heart of culture, commerce, and government. Even before the break with Alamie, Haes had begun to outstrip her sister city (Lofton, across the border) in size, population, commerce, and grandeur. Now its tall river walls stand pocked with decades of scars from catapulted stones. In Baron Hastur's nearby castle, a crazed madman stalks the halls, maiming all who dare approach close enough to possibly gain control of the Torc of Splendor. The cries of the weak and inexperienced ringing from the battered keep throw a pall over the surrounding countryside.
