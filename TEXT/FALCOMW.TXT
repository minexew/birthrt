^F02^W304Falcon's Roost is the home and laboratory of Caine, the Wizard of Endier. His tower rises from a swamp that is fed by no spring, and stays warm even in the harshest of winters. The tower is a seemingly delicate, slender spire that reaches high into the sky. Its pinnacle is at least 200 feet from the ground, and there are no obvious entrances to the building. No one knows where Caine got it, and few care to brave his legendary, unpredictable temper to ask. But, the legend of a mystic Crown of Command draws folks to come and watch the tower from a safe distance -- say, a mile or two away.
