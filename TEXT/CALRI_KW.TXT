^F02^W304In the forested province of Calrie sits a powerful castle dominating a small valley. There are known to be secret parts to this weather-beaten castle, parts never discovered by the current ruler's men, entire sections that have never been purged of the previous king's evil dealings. In fact, it is believed that sealed in the lower dungeons is a powerful fiend who guards the Sceptre of Cuiraecen. If this is true, and the fiend is not destroyed, it may manage to break out and extract vengeance for being summoned and then sealed away. Its perhaps misplaced wrath may reach even you, Majesty!
