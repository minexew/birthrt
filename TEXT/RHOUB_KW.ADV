^W310The depredations of Rhuobhe Manslayer have gone too far, Your Highness! Something must be done, and you are the one who can do it. Our scouts have found a secret way through his forest that can only be used by a small group of heroes. This path leads all the way to what must be an escape tunnel from Tower Ruannoch, the Manslayer's tower. If you manage to sneak in, I am sure you can do much harm to him and his plans, despite his vaunted superiority.
