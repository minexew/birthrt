^W310    Greetings, Majesty. It is my pleasure to report that our political situation is stable and secure at this time. Our alliance with Boeruine provides us with a strong protector to the south. The consequent enmity with Avanil is of little worry since they are so far removed from our borders. The raids that we suffer from the goblins of Thurazor and The Five Peaks are more a nuisance than a danger.
   There are rumors that The Gorgon is up to no good again. But, then again, he is always a threat to the folk of Anuire. We must be vigilant, but need take no immediate action.
   Your rangers stand ready to do thy further bidding, Majesty.
