^F02^W310The Spiderfell is a large, dark, maze-like forest made even more bewildering by spells of confusion. Its strange twists and turns often ensnare the unwary. Along with the many natural dangers here, the Spiderfell is host to giant insects and arachnids all loyal to the awnshegh known as The Spider. It is believed that deep within the Spiderfell are hollowed out tree dwellings, one of which is reported to hide the entrance to the root-lined caverns of the dread spider king's underground domain. Likewise, it is rumored that within the caves lies a lake of acid, around which the mad spider king, Tal-Qazar, circles, as if guarding some fabulous treasure. If the rumors are true it would be Nappolan's Tome of War. This relic, along with some other valuable items scattered throughout the forest, were accumulated after years of The Spider's conquests. These are the only remnants of those fallen warriors brave enough to have tested the Spider's Lair and its awnshegh master.
