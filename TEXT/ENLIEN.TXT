^F06Archpriest Suris Enlien
^F02^W300This beautiful priestess is tough and independent, seizing the three provinces that compose Medoere from Diemed and forging a new theocratic kingdom.  She keeps close watch over her lands, ruling with a velvet fist.  As a priestess of the god of moon and magic, she spends most of her days abed and works under the moon at night.
