^W310     Your Majesty, I have prepared for you a summary of a few points of interest about the domain you are to rule.  Once your Highness has heard my dissertation, I trust that you will decide where to direct your energies.  Perhaps I might humbly suggest ridding the sacred forest of the goblins of Markazor, or seeking out some adventure that may provide a useful tool of magic.
