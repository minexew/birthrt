^W310     Gracious and most wise leader, pay heed to my report.
     Tuarhievel's allies include Dhoesone and the Sielwode. The two have bound their realms together, allowing trade to and from Dhoesone to flow freely in Tuarhievel. Still, most humans fear elves' wrath and steer clear of involving themselves in this realm's affairs.  The Sielwode, as the only other elf realm in Anuire (besides Rhuobhe), is a natural ally.
     Your Majesty, because of the anguish arising from human murders, some say the Shadow World presses close in parts of Tuarhievel. In the heavy, wooded darkness, ghosts and specters rise from where they were slain, seeking the elves responsible for their deaths. Likewise, the elven dead walk again to wreak havoc on humans who have despoiled these lands.
