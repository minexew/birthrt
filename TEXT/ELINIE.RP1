^W310     Your army is strong, Your Highness. We have: 1 unit of dedicated scouts and 4 units of cavalry.
     As you may be aware, evil menaces from the north, and to the south is Ghoere.  It would be wise to keep a close watch on these borders. 
     Tuornen is a tentative ally because, in your infinite wisdom, you have been cautious in your alignments.  Keep this resource intact, if possible, and he will back your bid for the Iron Throne.
