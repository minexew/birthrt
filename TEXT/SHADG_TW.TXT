^F02^W304Like many enchanted locations in Anuire, once a year on the Eve of the Dead, tales tell of the opening of a gate to the Shadow World. Vile unliving shadow monsters, and other unpleasant fiends, cross over from the dismal world to walk the lands for a week. Eight days later, having caused significant havoc in the realm, the loathsome minions are pulled back into the Shadow Realms. Occasionally undead creatures of great power, and even dead awnsheghlien, are capable of resisting the pull of the Shadow World once they have crossed over. It is believed that one such spider-like creature is managing to maintain an open portal in Spirit's End.
