^F02^W310Stormpoint is the capital of Taeghas, a small realm on the west coast of Anuire. It is ruled by Harald Khorien, a mage of moderate power whose control of all the sources within his large, but poorly populated realm, make him a force to be reckoned with. Khorien really has no interest in ruling his kingdom, thus he has agreed to serve Prince Darien Avan and keep vigil over the Robes of the Masses. Because Stormpoint is the home of a wizard, much strangeness goes on in the back rooms. The halls are primarily inhabited by the wizard's guards, but there are areas protected by magical creatures. Almost all doors are secret, and there are some that are illusionary.
