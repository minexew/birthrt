^W310     Your army consists of:  1 unit of archers, 3 units of infantry, 1 unit of scouts, and 1 unit of mercenary cavalry.
     Of concern, however, are our enemies just to the east and northeast.  The loathsome goblins of both Thurazor and the Five Peaks see Talinie as a cheap source of raw materials and frequently cross the border to obtain needed lumber and ores.  Since the industries of Talinie have paltry defenses, the raiders take what they want with little trouble.  We should rid Anuire of them once and for all.  But you will, I am sure, make a wise decision as to the course of action we should take.
