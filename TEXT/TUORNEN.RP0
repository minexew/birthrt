^W310     The kingdom of Tuornen has healed from the wounds of the war fought 100 years ago. Still, as in the Heartlands, places in the countryside remain where no living thing will grow again. The prairie in the south slowly gives way to the hills of the western provinces, which in turn become mountains, forest, or a little of both. But those who would travel here, through Elevesnemiere or Pechalinn, should take care, for Rhuobhe's domain lies nearby, and human-hating elves sometimes creep from Rhuobhe into Tuornen to slay "despoilers of the land."
     Lofton sits just across the Tuor River from Alamie's capital.  In the past the walled city has kept out several Alamien invasions, bearing permanent scars as proof and reminding all of the price of freedom.
     The Tuor River is Tuornen's main trade route, making the city of Haes a veritable seaport. From the northern hills and mountains and the western forest come a plethora of goods: lumber, furniture, gold, silver, and coal.  Though no Imperial Capital, Haes remains one of the Heartland's main cities.
