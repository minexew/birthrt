   A cold Northern Marches realm, this once beauti-
   ful country has been stripped and harvested
   of its resources.  Roads and stumps dot the land
   now, and the people have grown to be bitter and
   unfriendly, showing concern only for themselves.
   The handy roads and plentiful trade halls do 
   provide a bustling commerce for the busy guilders
   of Cariele.
