^W310Your highness, a most intriguing incident occurred last night; a goblin thief was apprehended during an attempt to enter the royal castle. When the guards dealt with the wretch in the usual fashion, a small gem was discovered. Its depth and character reveal such a flawless perfection as to assuredly be enchanted. The guards then promptly took the goblin before the captain, who was eventually able to extract the full story from the would-be burglar. It seems that this thief had just recently plied his trade in the fair city of Aerele. While sneaking around Baron Diem's castle, he unknowingly found what appeared to be an item of great power. The goblin's description of the jeweled robes from which he took the stone, as well as the nature of the stone itself, lead me to believe that the creature stumbled upon the long lost Regalia of the Empire. The exact details are not known, and the goblin is no longer able to elaborate upon his initial story. (I have already spoken to the captain of the guard about the vigor in which he carries out his duties, but this is of little concern to you.) Your Highness, do we proceed with exploiting this incredible opportunity?
