^W310My liege, you remember Caine, the powerful wizard serving the regent of Endier? We have discovered he holds the Crown of Command, an artifact of incredible power. With it his abilities are greatly increased, as might yours be, Sire, if you held the Crown yourself. My magics and more mundane agents have discovered a way into Falcon's Roost, his mysterious tower. It seems the entrance is high up, on the side of the tower. Once inside, you have but to steal your way to his treasure room and make the Crown yours! I am sure there will ample opportunity to acquire other items of great use on the way. Of course, I need not mention the extreme danger of such an undertaking, but I feel the gain is well worth the risk.
