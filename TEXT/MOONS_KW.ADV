^W310Your Highness, an emissary has just arrived from the rulers of Thasbyrn. The groom-to-be of their daughter is missing; he disappeared while traveling on behalf of the Impregnable Heart of Haelyn. His mission had taken him to the Five Peaks area, where he was negotiating on behalf of the priests of that order. The groom has been seized by a tribe of goblins inhabiting Gaelin's Keep, a strong warren in the wilds of northern Mhoried. Our agents found the hidden paths to the goblin's keep. It is in your power now to aid this young man and gather no small amount of influence with the both Haelyn's church and the rulers of Thasbyrn.
