^W310Revered Majesty, we have been watching the industrious and interesting activities of the ruler of Cariele. As you know, the royal castle in Caerlinien has been under constant construction and remodeling for many years now. All this work goes well, but the interesting thing is that he spends very little gold on his hobby of castle building. Magic is most surely involved, or how could he afford all the work that has been done? I have been watching, and the reports of your spies confirm my suspicions. He accomplishes the work with a set of magical tools, Barazad's Tools to be exact -- those wondrous artifacts forged by master dwarven smiths who were also great mages. With them, raising a great castle is but child's play. By Haelyn's grace, such tools would be a useful addition to your realm.
