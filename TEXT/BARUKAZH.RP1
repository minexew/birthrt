^W310     Naturally, Baruk-Azhik protects itself with an all dwarf army. The dwarves do insist on receiving some payment for their services (They've got homes to live in and forges they could be working at, after all.), but they agree to accept just a minimal payment.  Most units actually concentrate on maintaining security around the orog tunnels and have not necessarily readied themselves for an invasion from without.  Baruk-Azhik's army contains 4 units of dwarf infantry and 4 units of dwarf crossbows. 
     Except for the orogs within the mountains, the dwarves of Baruk-Azhik have no mortal enemies. Almost as great an enemy as the orogs are the dwarves of Mur-Kilad, under the domination of the Gorgon.
