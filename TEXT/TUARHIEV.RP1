^W310     Your Highness, here is a report as to the state of the realm.  Please give your attention to my report; it may be most enlightening.
     The army of Tuarhievel is composed completely of elves, as follows:  7 units of elf archers and 3 units of elf cavalry.  This army could repel the Gorgon's tentative advances, but likely would not stand against a full invasion.
