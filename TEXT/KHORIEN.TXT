^F06Count of Taeghas, Harald Khorien
^F02^W310
Having sworn fealty to Darian Avan, this count leaves
the administration of his kingdom to the bureaucrats
to the east.  He prefers to pursue his studies of the
magical arts.  He does, however, show a willingness to
defend his borders against those he disagrees with.
