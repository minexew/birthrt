^W310Majesty, please forgive this intrusion, but we have just received a letter of grave import. A small border knight by the name of Morden, of the Kingdom of Aerenwe, has unearthed a dark secret that has lain buried for far too long. The weight of this knowledge burdens all who live within the realm. It seems that the previous ruling family of his demesne had sold themselves to the darker powers. In return for a fleeting benefit, these dark forces were allowed to cross over from the shadow realms. It has long been thought that all had been eradicated, but now a dark fiend has arisen to trouble his lands. It has gone well past the stage of petty villainies, with the fiend having taken control of the Caer Callin and seized the minds of many of Aerenwe's loyal men-at-arms. Morden sends his appeal to you for aid in ridding his realm of this foul fiend, promising that you may have anything of value it may possess.
