^F02^W304Barrow Hill is the dark and moldering burial mound of the reclusive elf wizard, Delwyheinn. This tomb has lain undiscovered for many centuries. It is believed that the tunnels of this dire barrow are stalked by wraiths and zombies, the twisted remnants of Delwyheinn's dark experiments with life magics. The enraged creatures prowling the shadowy tunnels seek to satiate their grievous hatred and hunger for the living, as well as protect the magical Ring of Wizardry. Reputedly there is a sealed inner chamber in which the wizard's faded lich form sleeps, guarding the remnants of his library of magical data in the dank and closed confines of the decaying warren.
