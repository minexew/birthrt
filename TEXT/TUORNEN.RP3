^W310     Tuornen has gone to great lengths to avoid choosing allies that would anger another nearby realm. Your efforts to remain neutral have earned the praise of the Mhor and the Patriarch of Elinie, but one could not honestly say that Tuornen has any real allies. Even Avanil and Boeruine have not declared their allegiance one way or another -- which can only come as a relief to your Highness.
   We must watch our borders with Alamie. Duke Alam is a greedy man who covets our lands. Because the lands of Tuornen were a part of the Duchy of Alamie over a hundred years ago, he believes that they are still rightfully his and will go to any lengths to reclaim what he considers his 'historical rights' to rule here. Trust him not, my lord.
