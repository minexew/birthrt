^W310     All the provinces in Brosengae are well settled throughout, though none of them can rival the province of Anuire in Avanil for sheer population. The land not dominated by farms is covered in woods, and the woodcutters of Brosengae constantly ply their trade in the pine forest. Of all the Western realms, Brosengae feels most keenly the storms that plague the coastal region. Since here the trade winds from Miere Rhuann meet those off the Arnienbae and the Straits of Aerele, scarcely a day goes by without a storm of some sort. Whether a slight drizzle or a full-fledged hurricane, it's always raining in Brosengae.
     The two northern provinces fall prey to the trolls roaming down from the Seamist Mountains. Typically a garrison of troops has been devoted to the provinces of Marilen and Coere to protect the people from the creatures' depredations.
