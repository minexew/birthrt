^W310   As the only realm in Anuire ruled by a Khinasi family, Elinie finds itself politically isolated. With powerful and moderately hostile neighbors, we must always be on guard against invasion and raids. Fortunately, Mhoried and Ghoere dislike each other even more than they each dislike Elinie, not considering us as much of a threat as they do each other. This can serve you well in your endeavors, my liege. As long as they ignore you, you can build quietly until we are ready to move on Coeranys or Osoerde. They are the weak points that provide us our best opportunity for expansion.
   As usual, the elves of The Sielwode will ignore us as long as we keep out of their cursed woods. For now, it would be best to accommodate their wishes and face them only when our power base is secure.
