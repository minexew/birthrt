^W310   For a human kingdom wedged into the midst of a host of non-human realms, Dhoesone maintains unusually good relations with its neighbors. There are the usual troubles with the Giantdowns to the north and raiders from Rjurik, but the long-standing treaties with the goblins in Thurazor and with the elves of Tuarhievel have kept Dhoesone mostly at peace for years.
   Surprisingly, our worst relations are with our only human neighbor, Cariele. Apparently Entier Gladanil, Cariele's regent, has never forgiven us for refusing his suit, years ago.
   Your rangers stand ready to do thy further bidding, Majesty.
