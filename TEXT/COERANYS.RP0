^W310     The wide, rolling country of Coeranys ends in the southeast at the gulf that bears its name. The kingdom's terrain varies between grass and swamp, making it prime territory for raising horses and cattle.  Those who tend the roaming herds are known as landrunners. These rangers, trained from birth to know the animals of Coeranys, hold sole responsibility for these roaming beasts of the plains. They ward the animals from dangers both human and natural. Landrunners reap the highest respect in Coeranys, for their work keeps money pouring into the domain.
     Storms boiling down from the mountains of Baruk-Azhik and rumbling across the Heartlands find Coeranys their eventual destination. It's rare when a whole day remains clear, so this land remains well-watered constantly. The too common swamps and bogs make peat gathering a normal labor.
     Your capital, Ruorven, sits along the river that springs out of Elinien swampland. Any of Elinie's goods coming down the river reach Ruorven first, enabling Coeranys to tax them as necessary.
