^W310Your Highness, a shieldless knight has brought us a tale of great importance. While carrying a message to the Gorgon from his liege lord, a petty baron in the service of the Gorgon, he caught sight of an item of magic held in the Gorgon's own castle of Kal-Saitharak. The description he gives matches that of the Chalice of the Dead, a very potent artifact used for the dark arts of necromancy. Realizing just how foul and demented the Gorgon is, the knight fled, and our agents offered him asylum. Sire, it is your duty to see that such an item be taken from the Gorgon, for he would so misuse it. It must be placed into the care of one who would not abuse its powers, one such as yourself, with the wisdom to see to its proper usage.
