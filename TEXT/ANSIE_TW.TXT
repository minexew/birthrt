^F02^W304Ansien is the capital of Elinie, where Khinasi influence over the centuries has had its effect on the imposing royal castle. The brutal mass of dark, forbidding stone that typifies the normal Anuirean architecture has been replaced by a more elegant and flowing style, but a style that still is quite capable of protecting its occupants. Currently, it is home to many valuable artifacts useful for both war and magery. Within the outer ramparts, numerous secret walls and rooms create a convoluted maze-like path. There is supposedly a hidden trail leading to the treasury rooms where the fabled State Crown of Anuire can be found.
