^F02^W304Castle Aglondier is an imposing structure, with elevated spires rising above city walls. It is home to the ruler of Ilien, Rogr Aglondier. Castle Aglondier is ostensibly very plain and simple, little more than a tower surrounded by a wall and a few outbuildings. But remember, it has been home to a long line of wizards, so there is much that does not meet the eye. Inside its plain walls, wall hangings often disguise secret doors, and rooms are sometimes twice as large inside as they were on the outside. From afar it appears quaint, but those who venture near to get a glimpse of the Ioun Fist soon find that leaving isn't easy.
