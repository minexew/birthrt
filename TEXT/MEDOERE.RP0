^W310     Medoere's terrain resembles that of neighboring Diemed: predominantly hills and meadows. The fields look ordered and well-kept, and the towns form in the same clear pattern, but there's a certain element of chaos to the air that doesn't exist in Diemed.  The weather in Medoere is a little strange, affected by both the trade winds from the straits to the south and the constant storm brewing over the Spiderfell to the north. Occasionally storms will blow north from the sea to meet the cloud perpetually over the Spiderfell, and Medoere takes the brunt of the damage. Though the climate makes the land look a bit gloomy, it has given the populace that much more resolve to enjoy life.  Nature abounds with her natural force; heed the words of your wizard.
