^W310      It is an honor to meet with you, and I hope my report will be satisfactory.  As to the state of your army, though not as impressive as that of its northern neighbor, Ghoere, Roesone's army remains large enough to give the nearby kingdoms pause before they consider moving in. Your fighting force is sizable with: 3 units of pikemen, 3 units of archers, 1 unit of knights, and 1 unit of infantry.
     In the early stages, careful money management is required to maintain the army at this level.  As soon as the money situation stabilizes, begin to expand militarily.
     Though Ghoere's armies frequently "wander" across the border into Roesone, there's no real enmity there.  The only true animosity toward Roesone comes from the ruler of Diemed, who has regained some of the strength lost by his ancestors.  Though he has not declared war on Roesone, everyone knows he devoutly desires the return of all lands that used to lie under Diemed's purview.
