^W310   Coeranys has long been a haven of peace in eastern Anuire. The occasional bandit raids from the Chimaeron serve to keep her military active, though no wars have been fought in generations. The elves to the north leave us alone as long as we stay out of their woods. Elinie and Osoerde have other concerns to keep their eyes from us.
   The lack of hostile intention would be complete if it were not for the rumors of The Gorgon's plots. His many forces are simply too close to our humble kingdom for us to escape his attentions. We are clearly destined to confront this abomination as his forces continue to expand his empire.
   Your scouts stand ready to do thy bidding, Majesty.
