^W310Your Majesty, a talented bard has brought us information of great interest. While traveling the outskirts of the Five Peaks, he heard many tales of Barrow Hill, the final resting place of a great elven mage by the name of Delwyheinn. This wizard was reputed to be great in power, most especially in the realm of life magics. All the tales speak of the marvelous items of power he forged, but his tomb, ever sought after, has never been discovered. Well, Sire, with the new details from the bard's stories, I eventually scried out the location of Delwyheinn's tomb. Though in truth the effort cost me dearly, the price is trivial when compared to the pride I feel in serving your glory. But to the location, it lies in the province of Floodspaeth, just north of Alamie in the forbidding region of the Five Peaks.
