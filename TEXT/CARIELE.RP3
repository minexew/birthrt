^W310   Cariele stands guard over a most strategic pass through the Stonecrown Mountains. With our mastery of this pass and all the guilds and trade routes in the vicinity, we can control all commerce between northern and southern Anuire. Using our mercantile proceeds carefully, I am convinced we can secretly build up the mercenary forces you need to advance your claims against Dhoesone and remedy the insult they inflicted on you by refusing your suit. 
   Once we control Dhoesone, we will be in position to expand to the south. For now, Majesty, we must build our resources and prepare our forces for this mighty opportunity. I and your other rangers stand ready to do your bidding as we move towards your momentous destiny.
