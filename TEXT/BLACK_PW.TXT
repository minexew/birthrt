^F02^W304Forbidding Black Stone castle is where Farid's Coffer of the Realm now lies. Just outside the capital city of Seasedge, it is the royal castle and heavily protected by well-trained guards. Fashioned from ebony granite, the dark keep is grounded on a tall windlashed crag, which it shares with the ruins of many older fortifications. The antique structures erode away under the constant onslaught of time, seemingly a haphazard jumble of debris crowning the grass covered hill.
