^W310     With only a small, hilly gap in the Stonecrown Mountains connecting the kingdom to the rest of Anuire, Cariele almost saved the Northern lands from conquest. Only by sea or through this gap in the Stonecrowns could the Anuirean army pass into the Marches.
     In this narrow mountain pass, the entire second Anuirean army met its death, as an elven ambush rained sharp-tipped death upon the troops. Eventually, another Anuirean detachment managed to reach the peaks overlooking the gorge, but not before suffering additional losses. Ever since, Anuirean forces have watched the gap with a hawk-like eye. The memory of the ambush lives on in both human and elf memory. The humans call the mountain pass Mhelliviene, or "the Gates of Doom," while the elves name it Toriendor Cuachlimyr, "Fools' Passage."
     The winds in Cariele blow hard and cold from the Tael Firth and the North, blasting the northern face of the Stonecrowns.
