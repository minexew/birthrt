^F02^W304Ruidewash Keep is a tiny holding in the province of Ruidewash. Its existence would be inconsequential, if it were not for the Regalia of Empire hidden deep within. A band of goblins somehow managed to take the keep under cover of darkness, giving rise to the notion that they were supported by an outside force. The majority of goblins have gone out raiding the countryside, making a perfect opportunity for a raid of your own.
