^W310Highness, some very grave information has just been uncovered concerning the kingdom of Boeruine. Its regent has recently come into the possession of an item of great power, Farid's Coffer of the Realm. With this extraordinary artifact, his influence and power will swell, and the Iron Throne may well be within his grasp! We must do something quickly, or your own plans may be in peril. Though an open strike against him is ill-advised and quite dangerous, your spies have learned that he keeps the coffer under heavy guard at his personal estate, Black Stone Castle, outside the capital city.
