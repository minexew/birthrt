^W310Highness, rumors have reached us that Rogr Aglondier, ruler of Ilien, has gained control of the Ioun Fist, a magical stone that increases the powers of its wielder. His is a tiny realm, and his power small in comparison to those who serve you. As a consequence, it is fitting that such an artifact be held in your treasury and none other. Our attempts to persuade him to share the power of the stone have been insultingly rebuffed. Such is not right, and the punishment should be fitting. Do you not agree, glorious leader? The stone shall be yours; you have but to reach out and take it.
