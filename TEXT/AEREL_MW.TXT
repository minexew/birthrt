^F02^W304Aerele is a port city as well as the capital of glorious Diemed. Caer Diem, home to Diemed's warrior baron, Heirl Diem, overlooks the walled city of Aerele. Its heavily defended walls protect the most canny and cunning strategist in Anuire. This large and enigmatic castle is well-known for its complexity and the maze-like qualities of its layout. It is even rumored that, after so many centuries and so many rebuilds, a series of rooms have been lost and are now sealed away from casual entrance. Numerous stout guards watch in the outer areas, while deep within the vast stronghold a fiend of great power stands deadly vigil over the fabled Regalia of the Empire. The fiend's brooding silence emanates a near palpable feeling of malice.
