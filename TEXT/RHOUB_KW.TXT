^F02^W304The Tower Ruannoch, a tall, blackened spire of wood and ancient stone, sits on the banks of pristine Clearwater Lake. Its base is a colossal stump surrounded by walls of brambles and thorns. The plants seemingly scream in outrage at their forced sentry duty, as the twisted shrubs bar any intrusion. The keep can only be reached by a small, well protected path leading directly to a portcullis sealing the main gate. Inside, detachments of vigilant elven guards walk the halls. To defeat Rhuobhe Manslayer is a feat, but direct confrontation is not always prudent. The best way to hurt Rhuobhe is to deprive him of his favorite possession, the Tome of the Prince.
