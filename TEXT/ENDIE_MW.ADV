^W310Great leader, evil doings have just been revealed to us by our scouts. Trouble once more stirs in the Five Peaks. Brak-Nor Castle in northern Alamie serves as base for a band of Azrai renegades whose wicked deeds and practices are so foul that even the temples dedicated to Azrai could not stomach their actions. Through sorcery, deception, or outright theft these malignant denizens have managed to acquire the Emperor's Crown from the Chamberlain in Anuire. Who knows what else they may purloin, and to what foul purposes they will use their growing power? We must stop them, majesty, before they become too powerful. And, of course, the Emperor's Crown would make a nice addition to your own collection of artifacts of power.
