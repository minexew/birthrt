^F06Baroness Marlae Roesone
^F02^W304
A stern but fair ruler, this baroness knows what her people need.   She is unyielding and somewhat harsh in her actions, but she tempers them with a touch of mercy and compassion.  Her people feel no great love for her, but neither do they find her taxes and laws too oppressive.
