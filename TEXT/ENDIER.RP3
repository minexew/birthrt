^W310   While one of the smallest kingdoms of Anuire, our central location, plentiful roads, and powerful trade network make Endier far more influential than its small size might imply. With the sources we control, we are clearly in a position to influence the destiny of the empire. 
   The Spiderfell remains a constant threat to all, Endier more than most, since we were once a part of that realm. 
   House Diem must also be watched. When Emperor Roele awarded this province to Diemed so many years ago, they never faced down the spider to claim it. When Richard Endier stepped forward to advance his own claim, our nation's history was begun. Diemed's rulers have never forgotten, though, that this realm was once a part of their kingdom, and they watch for every chance to restore that claim.
