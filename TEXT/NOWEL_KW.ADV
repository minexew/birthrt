^W310While researching new magics to serve you, Your Highness, we have discovered that within the realm of Talinie, in the Thane's Rose Palace, is hidden Danica's Crystal of Scrying. Its rumored powers are almost legend, yet these rulers have long ignored the crystal as a gaudy and useless bauble, kept in their treasure rooms out of habit rather than concern for losing a tool of great power. They are fools. You should move quickly to add such an important relic to your collection, Your Majesty. It is your duty to strengthen the realm's power in any manner possible. Nay, Your Highness, it is more than that, it is your Birthright!
