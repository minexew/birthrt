^F06  Duchess Eriene Mierelen
^F02^W310
   Shrewd, expedient, and opportunistic, the Duchess
   has a keen eye for both politics and business and
   quickly capitalizes on opportunities that come her
   way.  Although she has sworn fealty to Avanil, she
   keeps secrets from him and plots with Boeruine.
