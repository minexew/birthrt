^W310One of our agents traveling through the province of Deseirain heard stories told of an old staff kept in the treasure room of Castle Lofton, the hold of a local baron. The locals say it is magical and has been there for centuries, an heirloom long ignored by its arrogant owner. We have compared the agent's report with our records, and it seems he describes a staff most like that of the long lost Corgandal's Staff of Transport. Majesty, the baron cares not what great power he has sealed up and forgotten about, and so does not deserve to hold it any longer. I urge you to quickly and forcibly act to seize it for the betterment of your kingdom! We have many more people to care for, and all depend upon you. It is your right; nay it is your royal obligation, to wield this power in the best interests of your realm.
