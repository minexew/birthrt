^W310   Our time is at hand, Majesty. Duke Avan has finally agreed not to interfere with your plans to retake Tuornen! If Avanil will not stand against us, then we surely can rebuild the mightiest of the Twelve Duchies to its former glory. 
   We must continue to be on our guard not to offend either Ghoere or Mhoried during our enterprise. We certainly do not need the complications that a war with those mighty powers would provide at this time. 
   Raiders from The Five Peaks continue to plague our northern borders, and there are rumors that The Gorgon is up to something truly dastardly, though none can say what his plans may be. 
   For now, my lord, we must avoid provoking anyone else while we reclaim our lost heritage in Tuornen. With our former strength restored, who is to say how far you may go? We stand ready to serve your interests, Majesty.
