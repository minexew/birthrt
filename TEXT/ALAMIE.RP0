^W310     Alamie has been unkindly described as one big flat stretch of grass. Though this picture isn't entirely accurate, it does leap to mind when a traveler reaches the plains. Until he gained the northern mountains, he'd have to call the terrain mostly featureless. Waves of corn fill province after province, and the air smells of fertilizer.
     Alamie holds one of the most untenable positions in Anuire. Stuck with a large border on Ghoere and another on Mhoried, the realm must tread a delicate line to avoid offending one of these two powers. It's usually safer to anger Mhoried, but one can push even the Mhor only so far. Alamiens also must worry about the threat of brigandage from the Five Peaks. Finally, they know that Avanil lies merely a province away, should the prince choose to march through Tuornen or Endier. Therefore, Alamie wants to regain the territory Tuornen now holds, to place more land between Avanil and Lofton.
