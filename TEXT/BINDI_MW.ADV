^W310An incredible report has just reached us, Your Highness, about a perfidious deed committed in the Imperial City of Anuire within the last fortnight. A bold thief has stolen the Banner of Roele from the royal armories and successfully eluded capture (no doubt thanks to the goddess Eloe'le's blessing). Knowing you would be interested in such news, I have added your spies and scouts to the hunt for the standard. Well, Majesty, we have finally succeeded in locating the stronghold of those responsible. I need not go into details of how such information was gained, but it is most reliable. The Roele Banner is in a fortress held by a brigand and his mercenaries within the province of Bindier in Brosengae. We know not what he plans to do with the royal standard, but I am sure your Highness knows what action we should take.
