^F02^W304Keirvald Tower, a minor baron's keep, sits outside the capital of Coeranys on a river bank surrounded by marshes. The buildings are well-built and maintained, but everything fights against the constant growth of the greenery. A spawn of the Chimera, who keeps watch over Faele's Ring, has somehow found its way into the tower from the surrounding swamps. With other malignant swamp spawn and undead, it now terrorizes the local villagers. Their despair throws the entire region into a dark season of dread. Only the light of your presence can possibly free the populace of the troubled region.
