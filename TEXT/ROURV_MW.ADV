^W310Your most revered Majesty, information has reached us about a threat to the peace of the Kingdom of Coeranys. It seems that one of the Chimera's spawn has made its way to the swamps surrounding the capital of Ruorven and there taken over the home castle of Brondorson, an important noble in that country. The awnshegh has brought in its own troops and now terrorizes the local populace. The queen has not been able to vanquish the abomination, and the Brondorson's have made a general appeal for help. If you were to rid Coeranys of this menace, I am sure there would be great political benefit.
