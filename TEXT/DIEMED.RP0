^W310     Though Diemed, like its neighboring kingdoms, is composed mostly of rolling grasslands, it remains uniquely beautiful. Farmers maintain its fields in nearly perfect order across the realm, and its orchards and towns seem just as well-kept. The strong-willed citizens maintain a tight grip on their emotions. Most keep to themselves, even in times of trial.
     The mountainous province of Bliene seems not so lawful, however, and in the mountains Diemed's true beauty shines through. Anyone climbing the tallest peak can see storm clouds down below, stretching from Brosengae across the plains of Diemed. One also might see the camps of brigands or stumble upon a solitary mage in these forbidding peaks. On a clear day, the distant tip of Mieres becomes visible, so locals often watch for raiders approaching from these peaks.
