^W310     Taeghas encompasses a wide range of terrain, though all its provinces share the same temperate, seacoast climate. In the north lies the southernmost region of the Aelvinnwode, while hills dot Aerele Bay on the straits. Rivers run everywhere, and moors cover the few places where the forest can't find a foothold. Sandwiched between Boeruine and Avanil, Taeghas has become the major battlefield for those two powers in the past.  But now that your Highness is here, all should be well once again.
	Look to your mages for the true power of the realm.  Their vast amounts of source will aid you in your bid for the Iron Throne.
