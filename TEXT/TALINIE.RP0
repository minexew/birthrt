^W310     The forest of the Aelvinnwode covers the kingdom almost entirely. Though most of its provinces have only sparse populations, this kingdom maintains sizable lumbering and mining industries. These efforts do bring coin into the domain, but they have produced a significant negative impact on the land. The woods slowly give way before the human expansion, and they don't grow back.
     For the most part, the people of Talinie share your royal opinion. They have to make a living, and why should they move away from the ways they know best? Some miners and foresters make efforts to heal the land's wounds, but they number too few to do any noticeable good.  The locals, a practical and religious populace, offer their stern devotion to Haelyn, as required by law. These proud and independent folk rely on only themselves and their god.
     The capital of Talinie is the fortified city of Nowelton in the province of Ice Haven. Hardwood lumber and coal are the dominant trade goods of Talinie.
