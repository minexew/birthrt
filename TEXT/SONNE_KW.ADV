^W310My most revered Majesty, strange news has reached us from Drak-mal castle in the Kingdom of Thurazor. King Tie'Skar Graecher has been seized and imprisoned by a cabal of goblin nobles loyal to the Gorgon. It seems that the Gorgon feels the king has become too willing to deal with humans, so plans to put someone more pliable on the throne. Elements still loyal to King Graecher have contacted us and seek your aid in rescuing and restoring Graecher to the throne. In return, they promise alliance and cooperation in working against the dreaded Gorgon. It would be a bold gamble, but if you could free the king, much might be accomplished in the north.
