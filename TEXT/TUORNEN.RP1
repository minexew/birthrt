^W310     We keep a minuscule army, so as to show as little disrespect to our neighbors as possible.  We hold units only against Rhuobhe Manslayer and the Five Peaks.  Your army consists of:  2 units of archers, 3 units of pikemen, and 1 unit of knights.
     All are happy to hear of your coronation and look forward to serving under your command.  We are sure that you will be the next holder of the Iron Throne, claiming once and for all your Birthright!
