^W310     Lately, Medoere has faced some trouble from the Spider, stirring again in the Spiderfell after decades of quiet. Small bands of gnolls have crept from the wood to burn nearby human homesteads or to pillage crops in Caerwil. Slaughtered bodies have been found in the smoking ruins of farmhouses, and parties of foresters have vanished with no trace. Whether this spells the beginning of a war, or simply a tactic to lure Ghoere or Roesone into relaxing their border watch along the Spiderfell, it still means trouble for the struggling theocracy of Medoere.
