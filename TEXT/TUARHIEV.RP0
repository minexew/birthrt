^W310     Your highness, it is wonderful to finally meet you. The state of the realm is, in general, satisfactory, but with the menace of the evil awnshegh, the stability of the entire continent may be in question.
     Tuarhievel, the last elf kingdom in the Aelvinnwode, remains a place of shade and brooding beauty, nearly the equal of the Erebannien in its appeal. The swells of its hilly landscape bring to mind an endless sea of trees.
     Tuarhievel revolves around your Thorn Throne. It's said the Thorn Throne will pierce anyone deemed inappropriate to sit in it. In the spring and summer, white and red roses bloom within its woody tendrils, while fall and winter find it bare. The throne stands under a canopy of leaves, in a clearing of oaks designed to resemble a great hall. The capital is in the province of Cwmbheir.
     Weapons and armor of elven manufacture, musical instruments, wood carvings, and statuary constitute the kingdom's main exports.
