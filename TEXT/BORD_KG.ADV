^W310Your Highness and most revered leader, the pillaging by Rhuobhe's elves worsens. The Manslayer has taken Elfwash Keep and appointed Nhoun the Elf his commander. This small border fort in Boeruine acts as a base for Rhuobhe's raids on the countryside. Boeruine's regent tried to strike back with his local troops but failed. His supply columns have been harassed so unmercifully that they cannot reach the fort. Majesty, if we were to use the tactics of the Manslayer ourselves, and avoid the use of large masses of troops, victory could be ours. If you were to lead just a few chosen fighters to the area, I am sure you would be able to sneak in and strike at Nhoun himself. Taking back the fort would surely place Boeruine in your debt.
