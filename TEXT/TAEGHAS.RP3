^W310   Our political and strategic situation is strong, Majesty. Boeruine remains a jealous neighbor that bears watching, but they will not dare threaten us as long as our vassalage to Avanil stands in their way. Of course, if your own ambitions are to be served, we must find a way to end our service to that realm as soon as we can. When that time comes, Majesty, it will be your challenge to balance the mighty powers of Boeruine and Avanil against each other, while you undermine them both!
   Of course, Rhuobhe Manslayer's raiders also require watching. They threaten any human kingdom within their reach. 
   With Avanil and Boeruine ready to go at each other's throats and with Rhuobhe busily weakening them both, I believe your time is at hand, Majesty. Now, with the magic that you control, you can make your own bid for true greatness and seize your birthright!
