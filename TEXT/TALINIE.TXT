^F02^W300This Western Coast realm is covered almost entirely by the Aelvinnwode forest, and most of its citizens are loggers or miners.  The forest is being pushed back by the constant logging and expansion, which angers the nearby elves.  The inhabitants of this theocratic state are practical, religious and, though somewhat crude, far from ignorant.
