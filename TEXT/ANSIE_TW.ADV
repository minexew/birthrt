^W310Glorious leader of the realm, do you recall our last discussion about the great symbols of power that would help pave your way to the Iron Throne? I have put my mind, and more importantly your agents, onto this problem. And, well, Your Highness, it seems success has come to us by Haelyn's grace. We have located the resting place of one of the most significant and powerful items of the emperor's lost regalia, the State Crown of Anuire! It lies in Elinie's province of Ansien, within the confines of a powerful citadel protected by many stout defenders. Who knows how it ended up there, or even if its owners know what they hold? But, Your Highness, none of that matters. You now have the chance to seize one of the most magnificent relics of power ever to exist within Anuire. Please, you must act quickly, before someone else uncovers this fantastic secret.
