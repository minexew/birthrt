^W310     We are a civilized realm, gracious Majesty, unsuited for the path of the blade.  However, through the use of the guilds you may prosper.  In a war of intrigue and design, influence and subtlety will be your closest allies.
     Your army consists of:  3 units of irregulars and 2 units of archers.
