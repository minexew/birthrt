^W310Your Majesty, a crazed madman and his henchmen are running amok through the halls of Castle Haes, Baron Hastur's stronghold in Tuornen. No doubt the villains have been driven insane from the dual ravages of war and a lust for power. The baron begs your aid in scouring his home of this resident evil. Highness, it will be greatly to your advantage to deal with this yourself, for Baron Hastur is quite influential. And, perhaps these ruffians will have something of value, for one can only wonder how they could accomplish their task without the aid of magic.
