^W310     As one might expect of a dwarf kingdom, Baruk-Azhik is mountainous country. Snow-covered peaks and treacherous gorges mark this domain, defying any who would traverse it. The air feels crisp and thin in the upper reaches of the mountains, and the wind can chill a traveler to the bone. Rivers race through the ravines, carving their way through the rock as they've done for millennia. Hardy aspens cling to the earth, and shrubs cover the entire landscape. The Iron Peaks protect neighboring Khinasi from the worst of Anuire's weather, which means Baruk-Azhik is buffeted all the worse. The howling of the winds, like lost spirits in these ranges, makes locals whisper that those who lose their lives in the mountains must inhabit the wind for all time.
     Baruk-Azhik's capital, Stone's Rejoicing, is located in Rivenrock, the province the overthane rules personally. All matters of justice the thanes cannot decide come before you here. This settlement has become the domain's center of trade.
