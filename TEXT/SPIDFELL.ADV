^W304^F02Majesty, it has come to our attention that, after decades of raids and depredations, The Spider has recently acquired several magical items of great power. We should no longer ignore this threat, your Majesty, for now this foul awnshegh may have become a true threat to our realm, rather than the nuisance raider he has proven in the past. We must pluck his new fangs before he learns to use them against us. Unfortunately, along with its many natural dangers such as acid pits and sturdy webs, the Spider's Lair is charmingly host to a wide range of dread occupants. The gnolls, goblins and giant arachnids patrolling the wood are enslaved and loyal to the awnshegh. Only the best and bravest of your subjects would have a chance in this foul den.
