^W310     Speaking frankly, Your Majesty, Endier is in a bit of a bind, wedged as it is between Avanil, Ghoere, Tuornen, Diemed, Alamie, and the Spiderfell. We cannot compete with the farms of the larger kingdoms, cannot raise an army to rival theirs, and cannot hope to defeat these powerful entities in any endeavor, except one -- trade.  Initially, Endier was part of the Spiderfell. Technically, Roele had awarded the land to Diemed, but House Diem never braved the Spider to claim it. As in the case of the domain of Medoere, an enterprising scion named Richard Endier tore away a province while Diemed languished under an unfit ruler a few hundred years ago. The country has managed to keep itself free of the Diem yoke ever since.
     Unfortunately, others before you did not manage the kingdom very well, and it began to slide toward ruin. But now that you have taken the throne we are sure to prosper! Roads run throughout the province, making trade and travel quite easy. At the junction of the Maesil and Tuor Rivers sits the walled city of Endier, the many spires of its Caer Endier castle rising high.
