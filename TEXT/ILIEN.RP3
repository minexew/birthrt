^W310   Though a tiny nation, Ilien's control of so much of the magic of The Erebannien gives it power beyond its modest appearance. Protected as we are by our alliances with our strong neighbors of Medoere and Roesone, we are free to work our will on our enemies, secure in the knowledge that to get to us, they must first fight their way through our allies. We must be careful to not abuse their good nature too severely, of course. Even good friends can turn against you if you call trouble to their door too often.
   Your scouts stand ready to do thy bidding, Majesty.
