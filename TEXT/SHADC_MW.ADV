^W310Your Highness, disaster -- we have been attacked by the Spider itself! Reports abound that a force of giant spiders have burst from the very ground in the lower dungeons of the castle. They have seized most of the underkeep and wiped out what few guards were there. The gods only know what evil plans the Spider has. You must act immediately, Majesty, or all could be lost! The only hope is to enter Barrow Mound, where the Spider King resides, and defeat him.
