^W310Your Majesty, our border scouts intercepted a band of unwashed and road beaten rogues several days ago. They were dealt with in the usual manner, but one of the brigands told a fantastic tale about a place called Malentor's Tower, in the Doom's Peak province, that holds the fabled Hammer of Thunder. Of course, none of the soldiers took his story very seriously, and the bandit was punished with the rest of the motley crew. It was not until last night that I heard of this tale. Sire, many details of this brigand's story ring true, and, after comparison with my own researches concerning this very same item, I am led to believe there is much substance to his tale. The Gorgon, being a well-known arms collector, has shown particular interest in the Hammer of Thunder. We must act quickly to prevent him from acquiring yet another weapon of destruction.
