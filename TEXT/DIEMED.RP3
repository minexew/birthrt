^W310   Diemed enjoys a strong position in southern Anuire, Majesty. With our law ties to Prince Avan of nearby Avanil, the strong presence of The Orthodox Imperial Temple of Haelyn, and the many guild holdings controlled by independent guilders, there are many powers with a vested interest in keeping Diemed safe and strong. 
   As always, we must continue to watch the Spiderfell for raids. Your scouts stand guard there, and your agents elsewhere, throughout Anuire, stand ready to do thy bidding.
