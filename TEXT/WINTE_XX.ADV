^W310Your highness, Winterroot is an ancient elven village which has lain undisturbed for many centuries in the province of Caercas. It has never been explored since it was abandoned those many years ago. None know why its inhabitants fled; we only know that it was quite terrible. The evil has probably abated by now, and its treasures are ready for the taking by one brave enough to chance its dangers.
