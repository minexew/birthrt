^W310     Aerenwe is the least developed of the Southern Coast's domains. It has swamps in the northeast and the Erebannien bordering the ocean the rest of the way around its perimeter. The interior terrain, verdant grassland, stays farmed and fenced. Aerenweans keep to their own business, but they know their neighbors and will defend their companions to their dying breaths. Though solitary, they are fiercely loyal.
     Aerenweans inhabit only three of the seven provinces, and they don't want to destroy their land through war as some other Anuirean kingdoms have done. It is well that Aerenwe's neighbors feel the same. No army has ever marched through the Erebannien, and none from Anuire ever will. Any ruler who would despoil the shady trails of the forest would see his allies turning into enemies and his enemies raving for his blood. An unspoken truce among the Anuireans ensures the protection of the Erebannien from war. Unfortunately, other parts of Aerenwe have felt the bite of conflict.
