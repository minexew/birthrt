^F02^W304The Temple of the Ninth Spell, within the city of Braeme, is being stalked by an invisible creature which preys on the life forces of its inhabitants. Patriarch Altaweir knows that somewhere within the temple is the Sielshegh Gem which must be what lured the creature. Being a temple dedicated to the moon and shadow, the place has many illusions. Though the method is unknown, the invisible creature has somehow learned of the call for aid and now haunts the temple waiting for any who dare to enter.
